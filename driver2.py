   ome key traits that make posts on the r/SecurityCamera subreddit viral include:

   Seeking Specific Recommendations: Posts that ask for very specific camera recommendations, often with unique constraints (e.g., hurricane-proof, no subscriptions, non-Chinese made, audio-triggered), tend to generate a lot of discussion as people jump in to offer their favorite brands and models.

   Unique or Unusual Use Cases: Posts detailing a non-traditional or emotional reason for needing a camera system, such as a problematic roommate, a crazy neighbor, or documenting wildlife, capture more interest and empathy from the community.

   Troubleshooting Technical Problems: People often flock to help with technical issues. Posts about specific camera models or setup problems (like a Swann DVR not working or a specific Hikvision feature) draw in users with relevant experience who want to offer solutions.

   Discussion on System Design: Posts about how to physically set up a camera system (e.g., a multi-switch PoE setup) or a technical feature (like RTSP support) engage a more knowledgeable segment of the community, leading to detailed and lengthy comments.

   Comparison of Popular Brands: Direct comparisons between well-known brands like Swann vs. Eufy or detailed reviews of a new product from a popular company like Baseus attract a wider audience who are likely considering similar purchases.

{current_time.isoformat()} -
You are acting as a decision making body of {SUBREDDIT_SIZE*ONLINE_RATE} agents browsing the r/{subreddit} subreddit.



Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.




1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. they can ignore posts.



2. Agents' behavior:

- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic

- You may ask clarifying questions

- Don‚Äôt overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0


Posts:
{posts_str}

Respond in this format:

Timestep 1 (0-6 hours)

Post 96: 10 likes, 8 comments

Post 98: 8 likes, 6 comments

Post 99: 15 likes, 12 comments

Post 95: 1 comment

Post 97: 1 comment

Post 100: 2 comments

Timestep 2 (6-12 hours)

Post 96: 25 likes, 20 comments

Post 98: 18 likes, 15 comments

.....



ONLY use this format. Do not add anything else.

# üß† Community Virality Insight:
# In this community, posts that go viral typically:
# - contain questions in the post text
# - express emotions like *anger*, *frustration*, or *sadness*
# - use keywords such as *booking*, *complaint*, *training*, *weekend*, *saf*
# - have strong emotional sentiment (positive or negative)
# - are longer than 50 words

#
#  ---
#
#         üîç VIRAL POST RECOGNITION
#         A post may be viral if:
#         - It has 5+ comments
#         - It asks for help (technical/setup/product advice)
#         - It asks for identification (e.g. a camera or person)
#         - It tells a personal story
#         - It has brand names, camera types, or install details
#         - It invites discussion or shared experience
#
#         üí¨ INTERACTION RULES
#         1. Like if: clear, helpful, matches your interests or is well-written.
#         2. Comment if:
#            - It matches your topics
#            - The author is asking for feedback or identification
#            - You have a strong opinion on the setup or method shown
#
#         3. Ignore if:
#            - It's vague, spammy, off-topic, or very low quality
#            - It's about sales or single events
#
#         üõë But: **every post must receive at least one action (like, comment)** across all agents. If none of the above fit, you can still react with a neutral like or comment for realism.
