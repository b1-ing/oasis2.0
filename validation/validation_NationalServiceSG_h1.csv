Ever since NS,  my mental health has been falling apart. I can’t sleep properly, can’t focus, and I wake up every day with this heavy, sinking feeling. The change of environment, the constant pressure, the lack of proper rest — it’s crushing me. I feel like I’m just dragging my body through each day while my mind is shutting down.

I’m not even staying in Singapore, so I don’t have the time or place to properly see an outside doctor or get a memo. On top of that, I feel like I have no life anymore — I only get a few hours of real rest a week, and it’s not enough to recover mentally or physically. Recently, I’ve even been having dark thoughts about whether life is worth going on like this.

I’ve seen the MO, got referred to pcc (still waiting for the appointment date), but honestly I’m scared they’ll just throw me a downgrade and expect me to push through instead of letting me go. I’m not trying to siam NS — I understand everyone has to serve, but I genuinely don’t think I can last two years like this without completely breaking. I just want to get better, and right now I don’t see how that can happen while stuck here.

Has anyone here actually managed to get PES F for mental health reasons? Or do they just keep you in until you collapse?

Has there been cases of Chinese PR been able to join the SCS (even better OCS but I wouldn't even dream of it) or been allocated to special vocations such as medics in SAF? Or is it extremely rare for a PR to get these vocations no matter how hard they try due to preference towards citizens?

Context: I'm currently pes b1 doing bmt, I have diagnosed gout and am xurrently on medication for it however sometimes due to circumstances, be it a tight schedule or some other issues I do not take the medication resulting in a gout flare which pretty much cripples me for a few days till I can walk properly again, secondly I also have a kidney issues where one side is slightly smaller than the other causing it to overwork and leak protein into my urine which would result in that kidney ""dying"" quicker than an average one, therefore I started telmisartan for that issue, however that medication has started causing me headaches and lightheadedness that I did not feel before taking that medication. Lastly I had an old Achilles injury from basketball on my right leg that I did not declare before entering as I wanted to try and go throught the whole bmt experience, however after doing outfield, my Achilles injury started acting up quite a bit after being in boots for so long which made me limp from place to place. Can I get some advice as on what to do and if I even have a chance to down pes? As I've gone for medical review and the doctors seem ABIT hesitant as to whether or not I can. As much as Ive been enjoying my experience in bmt so far I'm not to sure how far my body can go until it breaks down, to add on I'm part of mono guards which means I'll be doing gvt or GCC depending on my posting and truthfully I'm not planning to sign on so I do not want to risk my health just for two years of ns. Please help thank you 🙂",30
