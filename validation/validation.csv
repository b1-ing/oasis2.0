I don’t have a cloud subscription or account, and all four cameras record locally to the microSD cards I've installed in each.

I'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand  know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that’s how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. 

If this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that’s how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren’t first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house’s Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers.

Any help is appreciated. I’m reasonably tech savvy but I’m not interested in complicated setup and maintaining a server or some central hub. I only need 1 camera. 

Right off the bat I’ll say I’m not paying for a subscription service. 

I want just 1 camera for inside a small apartment, that will give me notifications if it catches movement. If I can get live video of that movement that’s even better. We will only use the camera when away and at night. I don’t want an internet capable (I.e hackable) camera watching me all day, so I also don’t want cloud services if possible. Local storage is preferred. I do understand that getting live footage goes thru an app and they can aquire it that way… if I have to deal with that then I will. But local storage is still preferred because I’m not paying anyone to store footage I don’t care about long term. 

Do they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don’t care about cataloging footage. It’s purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. 

Due to other post recommends. I’m looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I’m having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I’m not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it’s only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. 

Am I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill?

* I only need support for two to four cameras.
* The cameras would be outside.
* I already have a bunch of SSD HDs lying around for the NVR.
* The two places I have marked for cameras already have DC power from a previous ADT home security system. AC power would also be easy to provide.
* Since the NVR would be local to my network my goal would be avoid apps and subscriptions and I would simply view the videos locally as needed.
* I would prefer a WiFi compatible NVR and IP cameras so I don't have to run a bunch of Ethernet cable. My wireless network reaches outside just fine and has plenty of bandwidth currently.
* 1080p video quality is fine and 30fps would be nice to have but not necessary. I don't need 4K@60fps or anything like that haha.
* IP cameras that have some level of low light support would be another nice to have.

We recently switched ISP providers. Previous provider took back their mesh system. New ISP does have better wifi coverage throughout our home, except in the garage and basement bathroom(wifi reaches about 70% of the time). Now in order to get full wifi coverage in the garage, I was thinking of getting a single unit of a TP link wifi extender/AP/mesh. Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.

Currently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  
Would my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?

Any advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.

edit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.

The NVR is a 302-16E-P16-B.  Due to the facility layout having multiple buildings we have four cameras in another building and those four cameras are connected via fiber back to the NVR and plugged into switchport 16 on the rear 16 port PoE switch of the NVR.

However, for some reason the NVR does not seem to 'like' a 2nd switch where multiple cameras are residing on one interface,  I've seen this before at another site too where multiple cameras shared one interface.  Sometimes one or two cameras will disappear and then reappear, sometimes they all disappear. The connection is via two Cisco switches on a GB fiber connection via Cisco SFP's.  Cisco switches show no port errors, no connection drops, nothing abnormal on the line between the buildings.

So is the built in switch on the NVR not a true switch or something unique to the UNV unit where it only wants to see one camera per interface?   Is there a workaround to fix the issue of the cameras disappearing and reappearing?  Thanks!","UNV NVR having issues with cameras extended via networkI'm working on a UNV NVR system with 100% UNV cameras, no third party hardware. The NVR is a 302-16E-P16-B.  Due to the facility layout having multiple buildings we have four cameras in another building and those four cameras are connected via fiber back to the NVR and plugged into switchport 16 on the rear 16 port PoE switch of the NVR.

However, for some reason the NVR does not seem to 'like' a 2nd switch where multiple cameras are residing on one interface,  I've seen this before at another site too where multiple cameras shared one interface.  Sometimes one or two cameras will disappear and then reappear, sometimes they all disappear. The connection is via two Cisco switches on a GB fiber connection via Cisco SFP's.  Cisco switches show no port errors, no connection drops, nothing abnormal on the line between the buildings.

So is the built in switch on the NVR not a true switch or something unique to the UNV unit where it only wants to see one camera per interface?   Is there a workaround to fix the issue of the cameras disappearing and reappearing?  Thanks!",4
