I need some assistance with a camera setup I need to install. I was looking at Amcrest products.

Basically I have 5, 6 foot wide benches that I will be unpacking product on. Mainly average size Fedex bags and small form factor boxes. 

I need to be able to record what is being unpacked as well as the paperwork that comes within the package.  The camera will need to pick up my hands unpacking the product as well as the paperwork that I will place on the bench for the camera to record. 

I plan to mount the cameras on a bracket facing down at the bench about 2 feet above the bench. Each bench will have 1 camera.  I'd like to use Bullet style cameras but with a small form factor. I don't necessarily need crazy night mode or AI capability. I don't need mobile access either. 

I also need to have these cameras connected to a PoE NVR that will have no internet access, That can record a minimal or 2 weeks worth of continuous high quality (4K?) video. I see there are options for motion recording but I have concerns with it not working properly, so I'm focusing on continuous recording.  

The room it will be in will be well lit, so lighting is not an issue. 

  
I basically need a minimum of 2 weeks of high quality (4k?) video that will allow me to go back and clearly see what was unboxed and view any paperwork that was placed on the table below the camera. 

  
I used the Seagate Storage calculator and according to that, to record 5 cameras, at 30FPS, for 24 hours a day, for 14 days at 4k resolution with Video Quality at high using H.265 compression I would need roughly a 10TB NVR. 

How reliable is this calculator and is H265 compression going to give me what I need?  My biggest concern is not the actual recording of me unpackaging the boxes, I'm sure any decent camera can clearly pick that up at a 2 foot distance, it's more the ability to pick up what's on the paper. 

If anyone has any feedback or suggestions or insight that can help me get me the results I need, i would appreciate it.

There have been a number of times in the last year that a family member saw a reflection on the bedroom wall of something that looked like a pole being raised up, perhaps 6 ft long.  

The pole seemed to have a small device on top that seemed to have a  strange illuminator of some sort.  (I'm ready for the crazy comments...my mental and physical health is fine)

At times, it looked like when you are on an unused TV channel, the snow effect.  That's the best I can describe it....it was definitely not a solid light.   The snow effect seemed to have some colors mixed in...it wasn't just black and white.

I don't think it's an infrared illuminator because our security camera doesn't pick it up, and it doesn't capture the pole thing because the distance is far enough away and it's small enough.

I assume the purpose is to illuminate something without the subject being aware.

I'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand  know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that’s how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. 

If this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that’s how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren’t first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house’s Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers.

Any help is appreciated. I’m reasonably tech savvy but I’m not interested in complicated setup and maintaining a server or some central hub. I only need 1 camera. 

Right off the bat I’ll say I’m not paying for a subscription service. 

I want just 1 camera for inside a small apartment, that will give me notifications if it catches movement. If I can get live video of that movement that’s even better. We will only use the camera when away and at night. I don’t want an internet capable (I.e hackable) camera watching me all day, so I also don’t want cloud services if possible. Local storage is preferred. I do understand that getting live footage goes thru an app and they can aquire it that way… if I have to deal with that then I will. But local storage is still preferred because I’m not paying anyone to store footage I don’t care about long term. 

Do they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don’t care about cataloging footage. It’s purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. 

Due to other post recommends. I’m looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I’m having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I’m not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it’s only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. 

Am I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill?

We recently switched ISP providers. Previous provider took back their mesh system. New ISP does have better wifi coverage throughout our home, except in the garage and basement bathroom(wifi reaches about 70% of the time). Now in order to get full wifi coverage in the garage, I was thinking of getting a single unit of a TP link wifi extender/AP/mesh. Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.

Currently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  
Would my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?

Any advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.

edit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.  
NVR in living room to the POE switch in the garage are connected via an ethernet line that runs outside the house. i don't have the skills to run these lines within the walls nor do i have the time. lol. and would/could not spend upwards and maybe over $1000 CAD on getting it done professionally.","Installing mesh/AP in between NVR and POE switch that is connected to 4 camerashttps://preview.redd.it/2ukma27hxodf1.png?width=1799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6159c951fef7c9b6414661b70555891ce62f8f27

So I am in need of advice, I am looking for security cameras that record to a USB or memory card. I don't have Internet other than my phone. I do not require it to be in real time alert.

I have problems with my landlord entering the property unannounced, and am concerned it's happening when I'm not at home. Illegal and creepy.

I'd like to catch em in the act, so what set up do I need? It's short term, and I can't drill holes and stuff. Some sort of rechargeable nanny cam? One for the front porch, and one for the lounge room area.

84,Best Way to Share Tapo C402 Camera Access with Immediate Family,bbgarnett,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1lvxjy9/best_way_to_share_tapo_c402_camera_access_with/,1,0,3,0,2025-07-09T23:21:52Z,,"I just ordered two TP-Link **Tapo SolarCam C402 Kits** and they’ll be arriving next week. Will be using them strictly with a Micro SD card and no cloud storage.  We're planning to install them at our family cabin so everyone can keep an eye on the place when we’re not there—mainly to monitor the garden, lake area, and any animals that might be getting into things. I was wondering if there’s any way to set the cameras up so I can give people a **link** to view the feed, **without requiring everyone to download the Tapo app**. Ideally, I’d like it to be **“public” in the sense that it's easily accessible** (like via a URL), but still **private so that only immediate family members can view it**—not just anyone with the link. If that’s not possible, is there at least a way for multiple people to have their own Tapo accounts and log in to view the cameras and or get notifications? Just looking for the simplest way to share access with family without making it a hassle.

I work at a mall and we recently got a rooftop beehive. My boss wants a continuous live stream of the beehive to stream to a TV on the mall floor. The problem is that we don’t have a computer to run the stream so we need the feed to go from the camera straight to the TV somehow. We can buy a smart TV and weatherproof camera but are at a loss on what to get and how to actually set it up. None of us are very tech savvy, we just want a way to watch our bees! Any help is very appreciated!!! Thank you!","Continuous Live Stream HelpHi everyone! I need some help. I work at a mall and we recently got a rooftop beehive.

Just not sure if there's anything out there like it. 

Basically, is there a system that let's me connect the cameras to a non-internet wifi network (basically a router with no-modem) and transfer footage to an offline central storage hub that way (like an computer or harddrive also on the network)

Would a normal wifi-camera set up allow me to do that?

Sorry if the question doesn't quite make sense. Im just not familiar enough with the industry to know what terminology to even look for. I've been hesitant to look at home secuirty systems because I don't like the idea of someone potentially being able to get into my home Internet wifi, and access the system from the internet (yes, I'm paranoid).

Figure with a non-internet connected wifi, at least someone would have to be phsycially close to try to get in.
