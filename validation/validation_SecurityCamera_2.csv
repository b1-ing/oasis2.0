I think it was exposed directly to the internet for a few weeks and that's how it got compromised","Compromised Sibel NVRMy network kept getting flooded and take offline.

I discovered that my Sibel NVR NVR-SB8ME-8P has some malware or something on it that is sending data out to unknown wierd IP addresses that come back as malicious. I set the network setting to a different DNS [9.9.9.9](http://9.9.9.9) to see if that help but, the packet captures still show the malware is using [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8) to reach out to bad URL and IP's

  
I have tried to factory reset the NVR to see if that would wipe the hack, but that didn't work.

Does anyone know how this would have been accessed where I can get onto the system and remove it?

I'm trying to figure out what's going on with a property of mine in Manhattan. There's a small outdoor area that keeps getting opened or possibly broken into—I’m not sure if it’s people or animals. It’s nothing valuable, just a basement window, but it’s happening repeatedly, and it's driving me crazy.

I have a camera on it, but at night, the image gets completely washed out. The alley light and the basement interior light blow out the picture, so I can’t make out any details. I’ve turned off the camera’s IR and status lights, and it’s pressed against the glass. During the day, the image is fine. At night, it’s useless. I don’t want to stay up all night watching it—I just need to capture what’s happening.

Is there a Wi-Fi camera that won’t get blown out at night through a window? Zoom would be great (optical preferred), but not critical. I just want a clear image so I can finally get to the bottom of this. 

For reference, I've tried several Wyze and Reolink cameras with limited success. The quality just isn't good. I'm ready to spend some serious money. I use the Ring ecosystem for my smart home devices—are there any good indoor cameras?

Oh, and mounting a camera outside isn't an option - it's about 100 feet from my window, and between my window and the garage basement, there's a public alley.","Security camera that doesn't get washed out at night by street light etc.

That being said, I guess I'd lean towards an eight-port NVR. I have been looking at Hikvision and Amcrest products primarily, so to give you a sense, I am looking to spend $600-$800 or so on both the NVR and a dual-lens camera. I am looking to monitor about 50 feet of area on the front of my house by a garage and have it shoot out about 100 feet past the driveway into the street.

The question I have right now is about the Amcrest dual lens cameras on Amazon. One comes in at $400 and is 8MP per lens, and the cheaper $180 one appears to be 4MP per lens. Oh, and the $400 one has 131 feet of night color while the $180 one has 65 feet of night color. I am not sure if that is worth the extra $220, including twice the megapixels, or if that is a gimmick. Below are the links to the two cameras.

Also, I am pretty open to other brands, and to be honest, I have no real idea about NVRs and whether more expensive ones offer features worth the extra cost. All I know is some require you to buy an HDD, and some have them installed.

My main focus in this system would be ease of monitoring from an iPhone. I have had enough of watching goofy ads on the Yi app. I even tried to toggle off the personal ads, but I still seem to get them. Oh, and something from a brand that has a good reputation and products, as I can see myself replacing the rest of the Yi cameras in the future.

94,What to keep in mind when hiring pros to install wired security cameras?,OJ_Jane,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1mabrvu/what_to_keep_in_mind_when_hiring_pros_to_install/,2,0,24,0,2025-07-27T03:05:39Z,,"Hi, 
I’m planning to install a wired 4K security camera system (4 outdoor camera) on a home in the Seattle area. I’m leaning toward hiring professionals for the installation to make sure it’s done right and the wiring is clean.

I’d love your advice on a few things:
	•	What should I look for or ask when choosing a company or installer?
	•	Any red flags or common mistakes to avoid?
	•	Roughly how much should I expect to pay for professional installation ? (Ballpark estimates are fine)

Appreciate any tips or insights you’re willing to share!

I need this type of camera that has that creepy look  because I am a custodian owner of a massive facility that is often frequented by kids which is very annoying.

Is this likely a security camera if it makes a click and then shows a red LED/IR sensor?

Can I just add more security cameras but dress them up in miniature doll clothing to give that weird and creepy vibe???","Can anyone identify this security camera make and model?

I have powerful wifi (thank you Starlink) does anyone know of any kind of small camera I can use and leave plugged in to check the other side of the house without having to sign up and/or pay or give access to some third party to use the cameras?  

  
For what it is worth, I have power outlets where I want the cameras, and they don't have to be night vision or even color.

99,Wireless Security Camera that filters out cars,bss05,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m9z6rm/wireless_security_camera_that_filters_out_cars/,2,0,9,0,2025-07-26T17:31:13Z,,"I have an issue where a crazy neighbor is walking down the road in front of our house and shouts abuse at us on a daily basis, and occasionally trespasses onto our land. I thought putting a camera up on a tree by the road might dissuade him and I can collect footage in case we ever need to prosecute him. 

My concerns are : 

1) The road is 100 ft from the house so it can't be wired - I'm hoping that buying a wifi extender will extend the range to the unit. I could have it by the house but it wouldnt be visible from the road and woudnt act as a deterrent. 

2) The road is busy and cars are passing almost every minute of the day. How good are the AI units in filtering out cars? It will be directed down the road - and the turning is 200ft away so that's a lot of road it will be capturing.

3) I'm on a tight budget. Not keen on a subscription model.   

I thought this unit might be good as it has 2 cameras so can capture him as he passes by - [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DWFKVNV3?smid=A8EBZYH92U6B8&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DWFKVNV3?smid=A8EBZYH92U6B8&amp;th=1) 

But if the AI isn't good about filtering cars then the SD card will be full in a day. 

I have read the Reolink Altas PT Ultra might be a solution as it records 24/7.

Would greatly appreciate any suggestions!","Wireless Security Camera that filters out carsI have an issue where a crazy neighbor is walking down the road in front of our house and shouts abuse at us on a daily basis, and occasionally trespasses onto our land.
