I set the network setting to a different DNS [9.9.9.9](http://9.9.9.9) to see if that help but, the packet captures still show the malware is using [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8) to reach out to bad URL and IP's

  
I have tried to factory reset the NVR to see if that would wipe the hack, but that didn't work.

Does anyone know how this would have been accessed where I can get onto the system and remove it?

47,Security camera that doesn't get washed out at night by street light etc.,JMVNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1mh7lpx/security_camera_that_doesnt_get_washed_out_at/,1,0,3,0,2025-08-04T08:09:49Z,,"

I'm trying to figure out what's going on with a property of mine in Manhattan. There's a small outdoor area that keeps getting opened or possibly broken into—I’m not sure if it’s people or animals. It’s nothing valuable, just a basement window, but it’s happening repeatedly, and it's driving me crazy.

I have a camera on it, but at night, the image gets completely washed out. The alley light and the basement interior light blow out the picture, so I can’t make out any details. I’ve turned off the camera’s IR and status lights, and it’s pressed against the glass. During the day, the image is fine. At night, it’s useless. I don’t want to stay up all night watching it—I just need to capture what’s happening.

Is there a Wi-Fi camera that won’t get blown out at night through a window? Zoom would be great (optical preferred), but not critical. I just want a clear image so I can finally get to the bottom of this. 

For reference, I've tried several Wyze and Reolink cameras with limited success. The quality just isn't good. I'm ready to spend some serious money. I use the Ring ecosystem for my smart home devices—are there any good indoor cameras?

Oh, and mounting a camera outside isn't an option - it's about 100 feet from my window, and between my window and the garage basement, there's a public alley.","Security camera that doesn't get washed out at night by street light etc.

I most likely will add more cameras down the road. Right now I have eight Yi cameras, I know about all the issues and the ads on the app, part of the reason I am moving on. That being said, I guess I'd lean towards an eight-port NVR. I have been looking at Hikvision and Amcrest products primarily, so to give you a sense, I am looking to spend $600-$800 or so on both the NVR and a dual-lens camera. I am looking to monitor about 50 feet of area on the front of my house by a garage and have it shoot out about 100 feet past the driveway into the street.

The question I have right now is about the Amcrest dual lens cameras on Amazon. One comes in at $400 and is 8MP per lens, and the cheaper $180 one appears to be 4MP per lens. Oh, and the $400 one has 131 feet of night color while the $180 one has 65 feet of night color. I am not sure if that is worth the extra $220, including twice the megapixels, or if that is a gimmick. Below are the links to the two cameras.

Also, I am pretty open to other brands, and to be honest, I have no real idea about NVRs and whether more expensive ones offer features worth the extra cost. All I know is some require you to buy an HDD, and some have them installed.

My main focus in this system would be ease of monitoring from an iPhone. I have had enough of watching goofy ads on the Yi app. I even tried to toggle off the personal ads, but I still seem to get them. Oh, and something from a brand that has a good reputation and products, as I can see myself replacing the rest of the Yi cameras in the future. The camera in my front is the one I look at probably 95% of the time, so that is the top priority now.

I’m planning to install a wired 4K security camera system (4 outdoor camera) on a home in the Seattle area. I’m leaning toward hiring professionals for the installation to make sure it’s done right and the wiring is clean.

	•	What should I look for or ask when choosing a company or installer?
	•	Any red flags or common mistakes to avoid?
	•	Roughly how much should I expect to pay for professional installation ? (Ballpark estimates are fine)

1) The road is 100 ft from the house so it can't be wired - I'm hoping that buying a wifi extender will extend the range to the unit. I could have it by the house but it wouldnt be visible from the road and woudnt act as a deterrent. 

2) The road is busy and cars are passing almost every minute of the day. How good are the AI units in filtering out cars? It will be directed down the road - and the turning is 200ft away so that's a lot of road it will be capturing.

3) I'm on a tight budget. Not keen on a subscription model.

I need some assistance with a camera setup I need to install. I was looking at Amcrest products.

Basically I have 5, 6 foot wide benches that I will be unpacking product on. Mainly average size Fedex bags and small form factor boxes. 

I need to be able to record what is being unpacked as well as the paperwork that comes within the package.  The camera will need to pick up my hands unpacking the product as well as the paperwork that I will place on the bench for the camera to record. 

I plan to mount the cameras on a bracket facing down at the bench about 2 feet above the bench. Each bench will have 1 camera.  I'd like to use Bullet style cameras but with a small form factor. I don't necessarily need crazy night mode or AI capability. I don't need mobile access either. 

I also need to have these cameras connected to a PoE NVR that will have no internet access, That can record a minimal or 2 weeks worth of continuous high quality (4K?) video. I see there are options for motion recording but I have concerns with it not working properly, so I'm focusing on continuous recording.  

The room it will be in will be well lit, so lighting is not an issue. 

  
I basically need a minimum of 2 weeks of high quality (4k?) video that will allow me to go back and clearly see what was unboxed and view any paperwork that was placed on the table below the camera. 

  
I used the Seagate Storage calculator and according to that, to record 5 cameras, at 30FPS, for 24 hours a day, for 14 days at 4k resolution with Video Quality at high using H.265 compression I would need roughly a 10TB NVR. 

How reliable is this calculator and is H265 compression going to give me what I need?  My biggest concern is not the actual recording of me unpackaging the boxes, I'm sure any decent camera can clearly pick that up at a 2 foot distance, it's more the ability to pick up what's on the paper. 

If anyone has any feedback or suggestions or insight that can help me get me the results I need, i would appreciate it.

There have been a number of times in the last year that a family member saw a reflection on the bedroom wall of something that looked like a pole being raised up, perhaps 6 ft long.

At times, it looked like when you are on an unused TV channel, the snow effect.  That's the best I can describe it....it was definitely not a solid light.   The snow effect seemed to have some colors mixed in...it wasn't just black and white.

I don't think it's an infrared illuminator because our security camera doesn't pick it up, and it doesn't capture the pole thing because the distance is far enough away and it's small enough.

I don’t have a cloud subscription or account, and all four cameras record locally to the microSD cards I've installed in each.

I'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand  know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that’s how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. 

If this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that’s how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren’t first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house’s Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers.

Any help is appreciated. I’m reasonably tech savvy but I’m not interested in complicated setup and maintaining a server or some central hub. I only need 1 camera. 

Right off the bat I’ll say I’m not paying for a subscription service. 

I want just 1 camera for inside a small apartment, that will give me notifications if it catches movement. If I can get live video of that movement that’s even better. We will only use the camera when away and at night. I don’t want an internet capable (I.e hackable) camera watching me all day, so I also don’t want cloud services if possible. Local storage is preferred. I do understand that getting live footage goes thru an app and they can aquire it that way… if I have to deal with that then I will. But local storage is still preferred because I’m not paying anyone to store footage I don’t care about long term. 

Do they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don’t care about cataloging footage. It’s purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. 

Due to other post recommends. I’m looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I’m having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I’m not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it’s only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. 

Am I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill?

I am looking for help and suggestions on what to buy for a small and simple home security system. There are so many options that I find myself fairly overwhelmed.

* I only need support for two to four cameras.
* The cameras would be outside.
* I already have a bunch of SSD HDs lying around for the NVR.
* The two places I have marked for cameras already have DC power from a previous ADT home security system. AC power would also be easy to provide.
* Since the NVR would be local to my network my goal would be avoid apps and subscriptions and I would simply view the videos locally as needed.
* I would prefer a WiFi compatible NVR and IP cameras so I don't have to run a bunch of Ethernet cable. My wireless network reaches outside just fine and has plenty of bandwidth currently.
* 1080p video quality is fine and 30fps would be nice to have but not necessary. I don't need 4K@60fps or anything like that haha.
* IP cameras that have some level of low light support would be another nice to have.

We recently switched ISP providers. Previous provider took back their mesh system. New ISP does have better wifi coverage throughout our home, except in the garage and basement bathroom(wifi reaches about 70% of the time). Now in order to get full wifi coverage in the garage, I was thinking of getting a single unit of a TP link wifi extender/AP/mesh. Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.

Currently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  
Would my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?

Any advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.

edit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.  
NVR in living room to the POE switch in the garage are connected via an ethernet line that runs outside the house. i don't have the skills to run these lines within the walls nor do i have the time. lol. and would/could not spend upwards and maybe over $1000 CAD on getting it done professionally.","Installing mesh/AP in between NVR and POE switch that is connected to 4 camerashttps://preview.redd.it/2ukma27hxodf1.png?width=1799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6159c951fef7c9b6414661b70555891ce62f8f27

I'm trying to find a basic camera to monitor my barn. I don't need any audio features, absolutely don't want to deal with a subscription, don't really need it to record anything. I just need to be able to look in frequently to check on them without walking out there at all hours, especially when I have girls expecting babies. Night vision would be important but motion detection is not, the animals would set it off every few minutes and that seems silly. It would be technically indoors (the barn is a concrete block building but it does have little screened vents at the top and bottom of two walls) so it won't get wet but it could get cold (just above freezing at the lowest). There is power out there in the form of a regular outlet (I run ac and fans in the summer) so I'd prefer a wired camera. The wifi does just about reach I believe but doing high demand things like video calls in there has had some crunchiness. I imagine that if its just sending video out, no audio, and not receiving anything back it should work? I'd look into cellular but I have a feeling that would be more expensive and I'm on a tighter budget with this. 

I did do some looking of my own at first but all the cheap cameras seem to require subscriptions and have all sorts of extra bells and whistles that really seem like overkill in this situation. I just need to know when one of the girls goes into labor or check in when I'm off the farm just in case.

Ideally, I’d like it to be **“public” in the sense that it's easily accessible** (like via a URL), but still **private so that only immediate family members can view it**—not just anyone with the link.
