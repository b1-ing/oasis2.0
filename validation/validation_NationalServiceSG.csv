For context I went to my medical check up recently and when they asked whether I had any mental health issues, I declared that I potentially had mild asd.

For a couple of years, I strongly suspect that I had at least mild autism as I related to many of its symptoms. 

The thing is that I never got it officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist. In fact I've never even been to one(only counsellors) as it‚Äôs very hard to find mental health help and proper diagnostic channels. Plus in NS, I'm worried that I'll face issues if I do end up having the condition and remain undiagnosed. Even if I don't have it I hope to put my anxieties about having it to rest. 

After I declared that, cmpb then made a medical review appointment with the SAF psychiatrist at cmpb. And with information online, I‚Äôm unclear as to how the whole process works.

So to those which have been to medical reviews with the psychiatrist after the check up

1) What can the cmpb psychiatrist do? If they can't diagnose then are they able to help refer me? 

2) As a general rule of thumb, should I go to another psychiatrist outside of Cmpb before the medical review(which is in less than 2 months) to get documents to bring to the medical review? What should I do if there isn't enough time beforehand

3) Other than that how should I present my case to the cmpb psychiatrist in general?

But looking back, i feel as though we are all trading our lives to beautify all the regular‚Äôs resume.

It is far worse when your superior is a maniac. Specifically mentioning my then OC xxxx(had to remove his name, by mod). His current position a Major now.

Guy is fucking sick in the head. Pulls the command team individually to demand that you add him as a friend on Facebook (then a popular app) and forces you to accept his friend request. This was just the start.

He then adds you into a group where he posts stuff. Be it comments, new posts, new picture, he expects the command team to like anything he posts. If you don‚Äôt, he tricks you into a hearty MacDonald breakfast and fucks you on the spot in the company office, screaming like a baby.

He expects the command team to be some sort of super hero. No reporting sick, no excuses, one has to suck it up and endure whatever you are having and push through the activity. Because either that or he treats you like you are malingering (aka chao keng).

He is the kind of asshole you would expect where he undermines your ability as a commander. Giving you instructions like for example, ‚Äúyou have to hold the ground and uphold the standards of your men‚Äù, ‚Äúall your men have to have ippt gold by this month‚Äùbut then he does the opposite and destroys this by saying its okay you can do better in-front of your men and fucks you up behind the scene.

Or screaming in your face demanding you to give him the exact parade state, expecting you to tell him the entire company‚Äôs individual status, sustained injury, duration of respective individual status and at the end of this ordeal, tells you he was just joking and tells you not to take it to heart.

Just imagine you just came back from a 16km route march. He shouts for the whole command team to gather and knock us down right under the noses of our men in full gear.

The reason(s)? One, the man did not know how to sing the ace brigade song. Two, one of the ice tray was not in use. Mind you we just reached the form up area getting ready for cool down exercise.

This mother fucker is so sly in the head, when you tell him something that is not appealing to him, or rather not the answer he wants, he was already thinking of 30 other ways to fuck you up.

Just take it that you sustained an injury internally, you went to a specialist to get it checked (always go to a specialist for your check up it is more precise and accurate).

Prior to visiting a specialist, i raise the issue on the pain i was experiencing.

This is what he told me.
‚ÄúIf your men were to raise this up to you, would you let them visit the MO‚Äù

My reply.
‚ÄúGiven the benefit of doubt i would allow them to visit the MO to get it checked‚Äù

His reply.
‚ÄúBut you are a commander!‚Äù

How do you reply him? Cuz at that point after he said that i felt as though i gotta suck it up cuz i am a commander.

Anw the specialist tells you that if you were to continue the way you train, you will worsen your injury. So the doctor gives you long term LD to prevent you to further trigger your already affected area.

You have an overseas exercise and before it starts you hand him this information and the necessary document. Him being a bipolar fuck in the head. Wanted to give you a good blasting but holds himself back (you can tell from his facial expression).

At the back of his mind he was already thinking of ways to make use of you to his advantage. Immediately the next day he sends you out to be some sort of ic out in the jungle, assuring you that he will be there to help you out in the start and end of the exercise to not worsen your injury.

End of exercise. What started off as 1 alicepack and an assault pack (for signal set) ended off with the two mentioned above with the addition of 15 jerry cans, 2 trash bag of instant ice. The fucker, no where to be found.

When you were back in camp on your fours due to excruciating pain, clown just walks up to you and says:‚Äù you are back already?‚Äù.

Two more things to add:

1.	‚Å†this guy loves sleeping and spooning people in bed. To which i feel he have groomed 2 guys to become gay like actual gay. (1 was a spec and another a store-man sitting in jail time)
2.	‚Å†This guy loves acting, in my honest opinion if he were to be in the film industry he might just get Oscar award. Why so? Because he loves crying on the spot. So one of our spec have passed on due to self infliction. We all attended the wake. This bipolar fuck was still bossing us around asking us to fill up the space in the front two rows at the wake, where by tradition was suppose to be reserved for immediate family. He then proceeds to show crocodile tears while saying how much regret he has on not treating him better.

In short just do within your means and do not over exert yourself for these type of fuckers. Honestly its not worth trading your life to beautify their resume. As much as possible try to do what is required but there is no point for you to injure yourself and affecting your overall health in the long run.

If your life is in any danger don‚Äôt be afraid to call the saf hotline. Just because you are a commander doesn‚Äôt mean you are not human. I mean if your men is smart enough to call saf hotline you should do the same (unless you sign on).

Special mention on him screaming at one of my man to win the soldier strong internal competition, particularly tire flipping, causing him to sprain his back, then made the command team to think my trooper was malingering.

Also, yes we won the competition got some belt (looks similar to WWE belt) but our PC gave it away because he felt that some rifle coy trooper deserve it better. 

Ohhh boy you gotta see how this prick got so infuriated and lashed at my PC back then. Its was as though a kid didn‚Äôt get his sweet and was throwing a fit.","NS: exchanging your life to beautify a regular‚Äôs resumeBeen a long time since i ord from national service.

You have an overseas exercise and before it starts you hand him this information and the necessary document. Him being a bipolar fuck in the head. Wanted to give you a good blasting but holds himself back (you can tell from his facial expression).

At the back of his mind he was already thinking of ways to make use of you to his advantage. Immediately the next day he sends you out to be some sort of ic out in the jungle, assuring you that he will be there to help you out in the start and end of the exercise to not worsen your injury.

End of exercise. What started off as 1 alicepack and an assault pack (for signal set) ended off with the two mentioned above with the addition of 15 jerry cans, 2 trash bag of instant ice. The fucker, no where to be found.

When you were back in camp on your fours due to excruciating pain, clown just walks up to you and says:‚Äù you are back already?‚Äù.

Two more things to add:

1.	‚Å†this guy loves sleeping and spooning people in bed. To which i feel he have groomed 2 guys to become gay like actual gay. (1 was a spec and another a store-man sitting in jail time)
2.	‚Å†This guy loves acting, in my honest opinion if he were to be in the film industry he might just get Oscar award. Why so? Because he loves crying on the spot. So one of our spec have passed on due to self infliction. We all attended the wake. This bipolar fuck was still bossing us around asking us to fill up the space in the front two rows at the wake, where by tradition was suppose to be reserved for immediate family. He then proceeds to show crocodile tears while saying how much regret he has on not treating him better.

In short just do within your means and do not over exert yourself for these type of fuckers. Honestly its not worth trading your life to beautify their resume. As much as possible try to do what is required but there is no point for you to injure yourself and affecting your overall health in the long run.

If your life is in any danger don‚Äôt be afraid to call the saf hotline. Just because you are a commander doesn‚Äôt mean you are not human. I mean if your men is smart enough to call saf hotline you should do the same (unless you sign on).

Special mention on him screaming at one of my man to win the soldier strong internal competition, particularly tire flipping, causing him to sprain his back, then made the command team to think my trooper was malingering.

Also, yes we won the competition got some belt (looks similar to WWE belt) but our PC gave it away because he felt that some rifle coy trooper deserve it better. 

Ohhh boy you gotta see how this prick got so infuriated and lashed at my PC back then. Its was as though a kid didn‚Äôt get his sweet and was throwing a fit.",111

I'm a PES B1 and actually am quite excited yet anxious to go to NS... anxious because I don't want to have a bad time being pressured by mean sergeants or not being able to make friends...

Cutting straight to the chase: I don't really want to become infantry guard artillery etc. boring vocations with endless training, despite knowing choice being a mere illusion in the military. I have been working hard as a biochem student and have knowledge regarding wound treating, pharmaceuticals, and human anatomy (also quite a bit of disease diagnosing and dissection using animal models), and I often collaborate well within a team as a leader (with rather positive morale). Thus I was wondering if there is still a chance for me to become a medic or sergeant as a PR... (or military police? I wanna seek some purpose during NS as well)

Has there been cases of Chinese PR been able to join the SCS (even better OCS but I wouldn't even dream of it) or been allocated to special vocations such as medics in SAF? Or is it extremely rare for a PR to get these vocations no matter how hard they try due to preference towards citizens?

I'm quite ignorant regarding NS facts so any piece of opinion or advice will be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Thx yall! I've stopped dreading about whatever vocation I might get posted to and decided to embrace it and make the best of it ;)","What vocations might a Chinese PR get posted to?I'm joining BMT in Tekong by Oct, and I heard that going to Tekong is basically equivalent to SAF.

You won't do IPPT but you'll still do Foot drills and prepare for POP Parade and Rescue Training. As for punishment s you'll write lines that's about it. Some days will be chill and some days will be shag but you gotta remember to count yourself lucky that you're not in Tekong training.

Try to not isolate yourself and dread over the month ah cause trust me you won't enjoy BRT if you do that instead socialise and get to know your bunkmates, your platoonmates and your Sgts, Enciks and Sirs ah. BRT was fun for me and I made alot of memories with them.

Lastly, since BRT is only gonna be a month, try not to MC or RSO cause really it's only a month and the time passes really fast and you'll miss out ah.

Will I even be able to show up? I don't think I can change the date that easily because this kind of thing is scheduled months ahead. The doctor suggested that if I really want a diagnosis ASAP and declare before I enlist, I'll have to go private. I'm thinking of following that advice but I don't know if it's any better. AFAIK the only downside to it is that my enlist date will be pushed back right? I don't really mind.

I heard if people declare during confinement they'll have to be excused from showing up or sit out some activities, all that stuff. It sounds troublesome‚Äîmakes me think I should just follow the doctor's advice so that I won't have to worry about any complications while I serve. Because if they delay my enlist date, everything will be sorted out by then right? Again, I don't know what's best so I'm really hoping to get some answers/opinions

TL;DR Facing mental health issues, not sure whether to get + declare my diagnosis after I enlist to avoid complicating things while in camp",14
176,How David Neo's Son Case played out actually makes me Happy,JiPaiHongGanLiao,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1mfcw9n/how_david_neos_son_case_played_out_actually_makes/,198,0,15,0,2025-08-02T00:30:47Z,Discussion,"[Previous context and history. -- Reddit Tread posted on July 14th '25](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/what_happened_to_the_case_of_david_neos_son/)

Firstly, I want to be clear that I bear no hate, resentment or any feelings towards David Neo. This is not about him specifically, it is a reflection into the system.

**I am a farmer.**  I grew up believing that hard work will get you somewhere, And of course, you must play your cards right. Like many of you, I did not have a father who was somebody. \[In fact if you didn't know your father, that does make your father as a nobody\]. I believe in meritocracy. Unfortunately, with how small Singapore is, and how everyone is related to one another, it can be hard to hold this value. You do feel a big sense of nepotism looming in the country. Whether that is true or not, I cannot comment on that. I am a farmer. 

 [There is a comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/comment/n36tpzd/)in the tread that asks if the son made it to command school. That specific comment was answered with saying that the son did not make it into command school. Further replies speculated that the son did not pass IPPT as the definite reason. 

Whether was it because of the incident, or because of IPPT, I am happy. I am happy not because of the former chief of army's son did not make it to a command school, but because the system is working as it should be. 

A couple of years ago, Winston Choo, who was the first CDF, attended his grandson's officer commissioning ceremony.  [This was reported by mothership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02B1AYrV8w). There were a few comments that hinted at nepotism and it was ""given to him"". As quoted from one:

&gt;Everyone knew he'd be an officer way before he even entered NS. Imagine the chief of defence's grandson not being a decorated soldier. His commanders were all probably too scared of doing anything to him.

It is easy to draw lines. And maybe more so that CDF is higher ranking then CoA. But CoA isn't some small time position either. So I show happiness, not because of the underachievement of someone, but because it is testament to my belief. The belief of meritocracy.

On the sideline I also wonder: what kind of pressure do the descendants of these high flyers face to perform, being involuntarily linked to that legacy. 

Oh, and &gt;!because I said I am a farmer,  I[ do enjoy farming videos. ](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSSUEmdGL/)As the saying goes:  ËÄÅÂ∏àÊúâÁ©øË°£ÊúçÔºåÊàëÂ∑Æ‰∏ÄÁÇπËÆ§‰∏çÂá∫ËÄÅÂ∏à‰∫ÜÔºÅÔºÅ!&lt;","How David Neo's Son Case played out actually makes me Happy[Previous context and history. -- Reddit Tread posted on July 14th '25](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/what_happened_to_the_case_of_david_neos_son/)

Got some questions:

Whats the shortest contract i can sign on? I seen on the website that it is 2 years, but alot of people tell me its 6 years, im confused. I want to sign only 2 years if possible, on the website it says its contract service 2 years.

Will MDES scheme require OCS or SCS?

What is MDES and what do they do? Will it require me to have some engineering degree?? I have a medical related degree if that helps.

There‚Äôs a certain leadership training institution that constantly preaches pride, discipline, and honour and all those polished slogans you hear at parades and see printed on banners. But behind that shiny image is a system full of hypocrisy, silence, and cowardice.

I‚Äôve witnessed guys joke openly about raping TikTok girls. Loud. Casual. As if it‚Äôs normal. And no one stopped them. No one called them out. That‚Äôs the kind of culture that‚Äôs being protected just because it‚Äôs easier to ignore it than to admit your future ‚Äúleaders‚Äù are morally bankrupt.

I once took a simple photo of someone I was interested in and somehow that made me the threat. Someone even threatened to find me over it. And what did the people in charge do? Nothing. Instead, they turned their attention on me.

I got accused of trying to hook up with commanders. Even one who was attached. Completely false, made-up bullshit, thrown around just to ruin my name. Just because I didn‚Äôt fit into their clique.

This place claims to ‚Äúlead with pride,‚Äù but all I see is boys playing soldier. Spreading lies. Protecting each other while tearing down anyone who dares to be different. Anyone who dares to speak up.

You don‚Äôt lead with pride. You lead with gossip, cowardice, and fear.
You punish the inconvenient. You reward the disgusting.
You tear people like me down and not because we did anything wrong, but because we refuse to stay silent.

My heart doesn‚Äôt just burn but it fking bleeds. From betrayal. From watching people I once respected protect filth while stabbing me in the back. From knowing that the uniform means nothing if the people inside it have no soul.

You warned others to avoid me.
But I wasn‚Äôt the danger.
I was just a woman who saw the truth and refused to shut up.

So here‚Äôs my voice. Loud. Unapologetic.
Fk your fake pride. Fk your hollow leadership.
And fk the cowardice you hide behind the ranks that you never deserve.

From,
A civilian who once respected people who went through the leadership training institute","This Is the Truth Behind Your ‚ÄòFuture Leaders‚ÄôI‚Äôm a female. And I‚Äôm done staying silent.

There‚Äôs a certain leadership training institution that constantly preaches pride, discipline, and honour and all those polished slogans you hear at parades and see printed on banners. But behind that shiny image is a system full of hypocrisy, silence, and cowardice.

I‚Äôve witnessed guys joke openly about raping TikTok girls. Loud. Casual. As if it‚Äôs normal. And no one stopped them. No one called them out. That‚Äôs the kind of culture that‚Äôs being protected just because it‚Äôs easier to ignore it than to admit your future ‚Äúleaders‚Äù are morally bankrupt.

I once took a simple photo of someone I was interested in and somehow that made me the threat. Someone even threatened to find me over it. And what did the people in charge do? Nothing. Instead, they turned their attention on me.

I got accused of trying to hook up with commanders. Even one who was attached. Completely false, made-up bullshit, thrown around just to ruin my name. Just because I didn‚Äôt fit into their clique. Just because I didn‚Äôt play the game. They didn‚Äôt care about truth. They cared about image, and I was bad PR.

Context: I'm an ASA, and in my office, the NSFs usually sleep during lunch time. I used to sleep at my office seat, but becos there's a ceiling light right above it, I can never sleep well so yesterday, I tried to find a new room to sleep in. I found this room which was supposed to be a lecture room (it just has stacked chairs and tables and nth else), and to my knowledge, it is rarely used, and there are also no signs that say ""no entry"", so I just went in to sleep during lunch. 

Then after I fell asleep, my superior came to that room and started knocking on the door to tell me to get the fuck out of there, and then I woke up and got out. The moment I got out, he scolded me for being in that room.. but there were no senstive materials nor any ""no entry"" signs that say I couldnt enter that room. That is not the worst part. The worst is he accused me of stealing the key to unlock the room, even though it was already unlocked when I entered! 

Apparently last week, the key to that room was stolen (which I didn't even know about.. I only know a key was stolen from my office, but not to that room), so he pushed the blame of the stealing the key on me and said I took it, even tho I didn't even do it.

Now back to the argument today, I admit that I was at fault for supposedly trespassing into that room without legal permission (but at that point I didn't think so as there weren't any no entry signs, which most army rooms wld have if they are not meant to be entered), but my superior doesn't want to admit his mistake and apologise for wrongly accusing me of stealing/taking the key. His explanation? He said that yesterday when he accused me, once I said no I didn't do it, he didn't push on the accusation. Well from my memory, yesterday he kept asking me why the fuck i didnt admit stealing the key, and tbh jus becos u accused someone one time and stop after that doesnt mean it makes u correct right? It's like saying I murdered someone and I realised my mistake so I stop killing people, without admitting nor apologising, and that doesn't make me a murderer.

Sorry for the long rant, but to anyone who was patient and kind enough to read thru this whole passage, are u able to give me any suggestions on how to settle things nicely with my superior? I'm also scared that he may charge me for trespassing so I am hesitant to escalate it to higher ups. Please advice me on what to do, thanks!

Hi everyone! For context, I‚Äôm a uni student (21F), I‚Äôm non-Singaporean (living in ASEAN). Since I was an introvert and my sense of humor doesn‚Äôt really match with my peers (I‚Äôm more comfortable in expressing myself in English), resulting in me not really having much friends irl. Luckily, I found some treasure friends online through videogames and one of them is an NSman, who used to be an Infantryman long ago.

Since then, he was sharing to me a lot of things happening in his NS journey, from his first-ever BMT outfield where he had to practically dig shellscrapes to his funny moments where him and his friends were trolling on their sgt, literally everything. He said he developed best friendships in NS who were his ex-bunkmates where they ate, slept, did everything tgt, and definitely enjoyed the NS chapter of his life. He even showed me a few clips of both his and his friends‚Äô parade, whole time I was just amazed.

I started forming a big passion in learning about NS systems (yet I‚Äôm not sg-based so my ns knowledge is very limited), but I do love reading ns stories so much, which is kinda weird coming from a foreigner; however this stems from the fact I don‚Äôt really enjoy how lonely uni is and how my life pattern just about same boring routine, slowly I found comfort in reading different experiences of nsf from all postings; from the bottommost stories (tiredness of combat load, unnecessary guard duty/night mission, screwed up meals, weird people etc.), to excitement in ord countdown. I don‚Äôt sugarcoat it and I know a lot people think 2-year length is a waste, yet I view it as a meaningful short pause from actual competitive real-life settings that you can only experience once in early 20s. And I admired yall so much for completing such an immense journey.

I don‚Äôt have nsf friends and I‚Äôm super welcoming to know more about real-time experiences!! I hope I can find some people to discuss/talk (or you can rant) about ns. I‚Äôm so down to hear that rather than just watching Ah Boy to Men lol.

274,Signing on to C4X? Worth it or not,Fred-ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1m3y4n1/signing_on_to_c4x_worth_it_or_not/,31,0,15,0,2025-07-19T14:52:05Z,Question,"Hi guys, I have yet to enter the force (waiting to be enlisted), but I am considering signing on to C4X since signing is best done during BMT, from what I have heard. I have read posts regarding signing on but they are about 3 years ago, so I'd like to gain a newer/fresher insight on the current state.  
  
Let me list out some of my concerns regarding signing on to C4X, hopefully any ex-regulars, current regulars of C4X, or even other vocation regulars could share their experience, stories or advice regarding this decision.

Pros:  
  
1. Sign-on bonus  
  
2. University tuition is paid for fully (this to me is somewhat of a concern, because my GPA will definitely not land me in NUS (yes I tried, my GPA (Dip in CyberSec) + Certs + Personal Projects + Extra-Curricular activities + Work Experience), SIT is my only hope. So if SIT rejects me, I would have no choice but to study private/overseas uni if I want to attain a Degree. My parents specifically told me that if I were to study overseas or private, I would be paying for the fees myself.  
  
3. Decent starting pay post uni (from what I heard about $5K base/starting pay for uni graduates), and will only increase with promotions. Not sure if there is risk pay for C4X.

4. Career and Financial stability, in terms of, I won't just get fired out of nowhere. (Unless I make a serious mistake, and the fact that I can continue my position even after my bond ends)

5. C4X aligns with my career path and studies, so I would assume that with the work that I would be doing in C4X, it would minimally provide me with beneficial knowledge/experiences/skillsets that are transferrable into the private sector, be it soft-skills or hard-skills.

6. Regular pay during my 2 year mandatory service

Cons:

1. 6 year bond, so when im out of SAF, im already 32. Meaning im tied to SAF for about the next 10-12 years or so, no room for regrets

2. Heard about the toxic work culture regarding superiors and regulars, but im not sure if it is as rampant in C4X

3. Potentially thrown into some sai kang BS role, which will provide me with absolutely nothing in value

  
For some context, I don't really mind going through OCS to become occifer, if it is part of the requirement as a sign-onee then so be it.   
  
I have also worked at a private sector company before, doing cyber related work. It is just 9 hours a day x5 every week (office / WFH), I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a mixture of boring/super-stressful, I would say that (in my opinion), most of the full timers there are overworked, juggling 7 concurrent projects at once with super tight deadlines.

Edit: Also how are leaves and holidays like? Am I tied to Singapore in the long run or can I take leave for travels etc. as well?","Signing on to C4X?

275,Worried I'm losing my bf while he's in NS,Fluid_Zombie_6197,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1m3xi25/worried_im_losing_my_bf_while_hes_in_ns/,52,0,52,0,2025-07-19T14:24:59Z,Discussion,"Hi everyone! For context, my bf and I started our LDR since before he started NS (I'm from a different country), and we've visited each other IRL a few times. Our relationship has been stable and healthy for the most part.

During BMT, he made a lot of effort to call and text me whenever possible and give a lot of assurance, even though his schedule was packed. During weekend book outs we could spend almost the entire time together, and I would listen to try to understand the NS workings since I myself am not from Singapore haha.

Fast forward to after BMT, he's in infantry and now spends almost 0 time with me. From my understanding he's around the same levels of busy as before, yet he spends much less time with me now. When confronted, he just told me that he has more friends and is getting along well with the sergeants, so he enjoys his time much more now with friends like ordering out and spending bookouts with them.

Thing is, he can go a full 24 hours without texting me, sometimes won't call, always saying it's past lights out by the time he's free. During weekends he spends more time going out with friends and family and doing tasks like getting a haircut or buying things he needs for NS. And whatever free time he has in between all of that goes to watching youtube or playing games. 

Usually, I wouldn't mind these things, but the change is so abrupt and sudden that it raises room for suspicion. He literally made an entire personality change within 1 week of entering infantry. Sometimes we're only spending 5 minutes per day talking to each other (text/call). And sometimes on weekends we may only spend 8 hours together (for sleep call - so we're not even talking).

I considered he may be cheating. He told me once that he was envious of his other friends who got to go out on actual dates with their gfs during bookout on night/weekend (since we can't, I'm not in SG). But he's told me he has me as his lockscreen and all his platoon and sergeants know about us dating. He's also told his parents and siblings. I also don't think he has the balls to cheat to be honest. I have access to contact his closest friends and family to ask, but haven't in case I'm just overreacting.

I'm overall just afraid that the lack of quality time may completely dwindle the relationship, especially as it is LDR where consistent communication is key. I think I myself may also start losing passion in the relationship as I spend so much more time on myself and my friends/colleagues compared to him. To me it almost feels like I have no boyfriend except for an hour a day, especially when my love language is quality time.

Any advice/opinions would be great, especially from girlies who are also dating recruits!

Edit: there are so many sickos in my DMs asking me if I wanna cheat on him. Get a grip bruhh üò≠

Edit 2: For clarification, I'm not in SG Uni and I'm working corporate from a different country. yes I'm older than him haha","Worried I'm losing my bf while he's in NSHi everyone!
