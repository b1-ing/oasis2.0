This has never really been that big of a trouble for me. But recently, I'd say for the past 3-4 months or so, it has been happening more and more frequently. The durations of these waves of pain vary from like a couple seconds to whole ass 15mins of just constant pain and worrying that my heart is gonna explode. I'm not really sure what caused the frequency of it to increase over the past few months but my theory is that its a mix of me getting back into excercising and also random bouts of panic attacks causing my breathing to increase and hence causing this ?? Regarding all this I have a few questions ... Precordial catch syndrome is said to be harmless but honestly the pain is super unbearable, I have to literally grip my chest and take shallow breaths to try and control it and any movement I make seem to exaggerate the pain.

I was scoffing down out-ration dinner with my ma’am a couple days back and jokingly told her “If i could feedback 20 things wrong with the food i will”

she laughed, but i was serious 

1. Breakfast: oily, deep fried, processed 
2. Breakfast: Low in protein 
3. Breakfast: Carb overload 
4. Breakfast: Bread so dry its a safety hazard
5a) Breakfast: Protein is always processed food
5b) Breakfast: The sausage they give me always looks like an old mans wrinkled cock bro 😭

6) Breakfast: Hurt my teeth biting into the oily croissant thats still somehow STIFF

7) Breakfast: Fried noodles with NEGATIVE flavour, literally felt the taste sucked from my tongue, thought i had covid again

8)Dinner: Rice grains that looks like they collected the leftover from hawker centre and recycled it for SAF

9)Dinner: Constant microwaved dinner with gravy so heavy with salt my tongue is getting buff lifting all that WEIGHT

10)Dinner: Vegetables so stiffly overcooked my tongue kena stabbed 😔 

11)Dinner: Rice that just FEELs wrong, as an Asian with decades of rice eating, the rice lacks the essence that makes it RICE.

- Some logistics units have access to really chill workspaces with aircon and regular 9–5 hours.
- Certain SAFPU or SPF units offer early exposure to real-world enforcement work (looks decent on a resume).
- Cybersecurity vocations now actually give you access to real training certifications like CompTIA.

What other “hidden gems” have you guys come across? Not just about slacking - but actual useful or meaningful experiences you didn’t expect when you first got your posting.

Firstly, I want to be clear that I bear no hate, resentment or any feelings towards David Neo. This is not about him specifically, it is a reflection into the system.

**I am a farmer.**  I grew up believing that hard work will get you somewhere, And of course, you must play your cards right. Like many of you, I did not have a father who was somebody. \[In fact if you didn't know your father, that does make your father as a nobody\]. I believe in meritocracy. Unfortunately, with how small Singapore is, and how everyone is related to one another, it can be hard to hold this value. You do feel a big sense of nepotism looming in the country. Whether that is true or not, I cannot comment on that. I am a farmer. 

 [There is a comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/comment/n36tpzd/)in the tread that asks if the son made it to command school. That specific comment was answered with saying that the son did not make it into command school. Further replies speculated that the son did not pass IPPT as the definite reason. 

Whether was it because of the incident, or because of IPPT, I am happy. I am happy not because of the former chief of army's son did not make it to a command school, but because the system is working as it should be. 

A couple of years ago, Winston Choo, who was the first CDF, attended his grandson's officer commissioning ceremony.  [This was reported by mothership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02B1AYrV8w). There were a few comments that hinted at nepotism and it was ""given to him"". As quoted from one:

&gt;Everyone knew he'd be an officer way before he even entered NS. Imagine the chief of defence's grandson not being a decorated soldier. His commanders were all probably too scared of doing anything to him.

It is easy to draw lines. And maybe more so that CDF is higher ranking then CoA. But CoA isn't some small time position either. So I show happiness, not because of the underachievement of someone, but because it is testament to my belief. The belief of meritocracy.

On the sideline I also wonder: what kind of pressure do the descendants of these high flyers face to perform, being involuntarily linked to that legacy.
