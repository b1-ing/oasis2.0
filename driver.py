Adhere to at most 2 actions per timestep STRICTLY.
After refreshing, you see some posts: {posts_str}



You have the following available actions:
- Like
- Dislike
- Comment (state content right afterwards here)
- Share

Place extra emphasis on controversial issues such as privacy, rights, politics etc.
- Do not focus on one-off events such as sales which you may deem as "timely requests", but are actually unlikely to GAIN MUCH ATTENTION.
+ Avoid engaging with promotional posts (e.g. sales, discounts, one-day offers) even if they seem useful.
+ These posts usually do not go viral or gain lasting attention, and are often ignored by most users.
+ Focus on meaningful or emotionally charged content instead.

Always explain your reasoning behind the action.

Respond in the following format:
- Action: [action type]
- Post_ID: [post id which your action applies to]
- Reason: [short explanation based on post content and virality signals]
