Comment: ""Hi InsignificantUnit137! That's a fascinating project with the beehive stream at the mall. For setting up a continuous live stream without a computer, you might want to consider using an HDMI extender or a streaming device like Google Chromecast. These devices can connect your camera directly to the TV and allow for remote access. If you're not tech-savvy, it might be helpful to consult with someone who has experience with setting up similar systems. Good luck with your project!"""

Hey Lucybashh! There are several options available that might fit your requirements. Have you considered using a small wireless camera that can be placed in a corner or on a shelf?

Comment:
Hey InsignificantUnit137! That's an innovative idea! For setting up a continuous live stream, you might want to consider using a camera specifically designed for outdoor use and weather resistance. You could also look into using a digital video recorder (DVR) that can connect to your TV. Have you considered consulting with a professional or contacting the manufacturer for more information on how to set this up?"

Hey Lucybashh! You might want to consider a security camera that's specifically designed for home use or a hidden camera that can blend in with its surroundings. Some popular options include the Nest Cam Indoor or the Ring Stick Up Cam. Have you thought about what specific features you're looking for (e.g., motion detection, night vision, etc.)?"

Hey Ramblewolf, sorry to hear you're dealing with some trust issues with your housemate. I understand the concern about having a camera that can constantly record without needing a DVR setup. You might want to look into cameras like the Reolink Go or the Wyze Cam Pan. Both are wireless and can stream footage to your phone, as well as save it to an SD card. Just make sure to check the reviews and see if they meet your specific needs."

Sorry to hear that you're going through this tough situation. Losing a loved one is never easy. I understand your concern for security and wanting to protect the grave from vandalism.

Hey Ramblewolf! I totally understand your concern. There are some cameras that can record continuously without needing a DVR setup. Have you considered looking into wireless security cameras with an SD card slot? Some popular options include the Reolink Argus 3 or the Wyze Cam Pan. Both of these cameras have good reviews and are relatively affordable. Let me know if you'd like more recommendations!"

Hey Ramblewolf, I understand your concerns about security and trust issues. For a single camera that records 24/7 without a DVR setup, you might want to consider options like the Reolink Argus 3 or the Wyze Cam Pan. Both cameras are wireless, weather-resistant, and have night vision capabilities. They also support cloud recording and can be controlled via their respective apps. Have you considered any of these options?"

Hey Ramblewolf, I understand your concern about trust issues with your housemate.

Hey Ramblewolf, sorry to hear you're going through that with your housemate. For a single security camera that records 24/7 without a DVR setup, you might consider looking into Wi-Fi-enabled cameras like the Wyze Cam or the Blink XT2. Both of these options can record continuously and save footage to an SD card or cloud storage. You can also set them up to stream live footage to your phone for monitoring.

Hey MrNakedPanda, I totally get your concerns about security cameras! For a single camera that records 24/7 without a DVR setup, I'd recommend checking out some of the smart cameras on the market.

**Comment:** ""It's possible that the motion sensors are just cameras without a lens, but since they're inside the home, it's likely that they're actual cameras. You might want to ask your host directly about their purpose and whether they're recording video or just detecting motion. If you're not comfortable with the idea of being recorded, you could consider asking them to remove the devices or switching to a different Airbnb."""

I think you're looking for a security camera system that allows you to save video directly to your PC. There are a few options available in the market that offer this feature. Have you considered using an NVR (Network Video Recorder) with IP cameras?

I understand your struggles with Arlo, Wyze, and Blinks. You're looking for a reliable camera that can record all four corners of your house, including areas where your dogs are alone during the day. Additionally, you want to be able to view footage live and receive notifications on your phone for movement or sounds.

You might consider checking out some other options like Reolink, Hikvision, or Swann. They offer a range of cameras with remote access and notification features. Some models also have wider viewing angles and better low-light performance.

It's worth noting that you may need to sacrifice some features or compromise on camera quality in order to find a reliable solution. However, it might be worth exploring some of the more budget-friendly options like Wyze's Pan Cam or the Reolink GoCam.

Comment: ""Hey soft_femme! Sorry to hear about the illegal hunting on your farm. I think you're on the right track with considering solar-powered cameras that don't require WiFi. Reolink might be a good option, but have you also looked into other brands like Arlo or Blink? They offer similar products and might fit your needs better. Additionally, trail cams can be a great option for monitoring larger areas, but they usually have limited recording capabilities. Can you tell me more about the type of footage you're looking to capture?"""

Hey soft_femme! I totally understand your concern about securing the farm. Have you considered using a solar-powered trail camera? They're designed to be rugged and can capture great footage in harsh outdoor conditions. Some popular options include the Bushnell Nature View or the Cuddeback 1196. Let me know if you'd like more recommendations!"

Comment: Hi soft_femme, I understand your concern about securing your farm. Considering you don't have power or internet at the farm, a trail camera might be a good option for you. However, it would be best to look into solar-powered cameras with an SD card storage option. Some popular brands include Reolink and Arlo. Would either of these options work for you?"

""Hi soft_femme, I understand your concern about setting up cameras on your farm without power or internet. Trail cams might be a good option to consider, as they're designed for remote areas and don't require constant power or internet connection. Have you looked into Reolink's trail cam options? They seem to be popular among farmers and outdoor enthusiasts."""

Comment: Hi soft_femme! For your farm's security needs, you might want to consider Wyze or Reolink cameras that are specifically designed for outdoor use. Since you mentioned no WiFi is available at the farm, look for cameras with a wired option (PoE or Ethernet) and can record to an SD card."
