- Comment: Hey, I totally get why you're worried, it sounds really tough dealing with this sudden change. NS can be a huge shift for guys, especially when they move into unit life and form new bonds with their section mates and sergeants. Time really becomes a luxury for them, and they often just want to decompress or hang out with new friends who understand what they're going through. It's not uncommon for them to get really engrossed in their new environment and might not realise the impact on an LDR. Have you tried talking to him specifically about your love language and how you feel neglected? Sometimes they just don't realise. Maybe suggest setting aside specific times for calls or video chats, even if it's just 10-15 minutes. It might help bridge the communication gap. All the best, hope things get better."

Hey, I really feel for you. LDRs are tough enough, and NS just adds a whole new level of challenge. It's really common for guys to get super absorbed in camp life, especially when they move to their unit after BMT. The shift can be quite big â€“ new friends, different routines, and they often form a strong bond with their platoon mates. He's probably just settling in and finding his new rhythm, and honestly, the free time in camp can be quite limited even if he says he's not as busy. Have you tried telling him exactly how this makes you feel, like the impact of the sudden change, without accusing him? Sometimes they don't fully realise it when they're in the thick of things. Maybe suggest setting aside a specific time, even a short call, just for the two of you."

- Comment: Hi, it's tough when guys dive into NS. Seems like a big change. Have you tried talking directly about how you feel? Maybe he needs to understand your comfort level.

- Comment: Hey, I get how you feel about losing mass. It's crazy how NS can affect your body. Are you getting enough protein in camp? That makes a big difference for building mass."
