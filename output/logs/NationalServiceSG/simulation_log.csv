**POST 94: Going for a surgery for my ACL, possible to Up pes to join a frontline combat unit**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 94
- Reason: Personal stakes – dealing with physical limitations and career aspirations during NS is highly relatable. Also, the query about transferring vocations is common.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey ACIDGOD47, sucks to hear about the ACL, bro.  Getting a surgery is a big step, hope it heals properly.  Regarding the PES up, it’s *definitely* possible, but it's gonna be a tough push.  The BMT’s gonna be the biggest hurdle – you’ll need to demonstrate you’re fully fit after the surgery and prove you can handle the physical demands of frontline. Don’t expect it to be easy.  Focus on getting your medical clearance sorted ASAP, and talk to your unit commander about your goals.  Honestly, it’s a long shot, but it’s worth exploring. Good luck with the surgery!”

**POST 95: How do emart credits work for nsmen?**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 95
- Reason: Addressing a practical, everyday NS concern – administration and logistics.  The specific question about caps and yearly top-ups resonates with my profile's focus on details and processes.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey NoAbility1842, this is a super common question! I think the caps are dependent on your unit. Some units get more than others. Also, the yearly top-ups *usually* happen on your ORD date, but confirm this with your admin. Don’t just assume – ask! The system is notoriously slow, so get it sorted early. Good luck chasing those credits – you’ll need them for laundry, man!”

**POST 96: losing mass and feeling depressed**

- Post_ID: 96
- Reason: While empathetic, this post doesn't align with my profile’s emphasis on structured experiences and quantifiable goals. It's a personal venting post and not a question requiring a direct response.

**POST 98: Signing on to C4X? Worth it or not**

- Action: ignore
- Post_ID: 98

- Post_ID: 94
- Reason: The post describes a serious medical situation (ACL surgery) and a potential career path change. It aligns with my profile’s interest in NS and possible career implications.  It’s emotionally relevant.
- (If comment) Comment: “Oi, ACIDGOD47, that sucks man. ACLs are a real pain. Hope the surgery goes smoothly and you fully recover.  Regarding joining a frontline unit, it's a long shot, but definitely worth exploring with your doctor.  Don't get too hung up on it though – focus on getting back on your feet first.  Good luck!”

**POST 95**

- Action: ignore
- Post_ID: 95
- Reason: This is a very basic question about EMart credits. It’s not emotionally charged and doesn’t offer much opportunity for a nuanced or insightful response. It doesn’t fit with my profile's desire for strategic responses.

**POST 96**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 96
- Reason: This post is clearly about a mental health struggle, a very relatable experience for someone serving NS (stress, body image issues, lack of sleep).  It’s emotionally driven and aligns with my profile's interest in personal experiences.
- (If comment) Comment: “Present-Pack, bro, seriously, that's rough. It happens to so many of us, especially with the pressure of NS and trying to maintain a decent physique. Don't beat yourself up about it – it's a sign you’re paying attention. Maybe dial back the gym for a bit and focus on getting enough sleep and eating properly.  Seriously, prioritise your mental and physical well-being.  You've got this.”

**POST 98**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 98
- Reason: This post is a lengthy, detailed exploration of signing on to C4X. It's a complex decision with many pros and cons, and I can provide a realistic, nuanced response based on my profile interests (career, finances, stability).
- (If comment) Comment: “Fred-ss, that’s a *massive* decision, man.  Seriously, you need to weigh those pros and cons carefully. The 6-year bond is a huge commitment.  I think your concerns about the work culture are valid – it can be tough.  The university tuition payout is amazing if you get into SIT, but honestly, competition for NUS is brutal.  Don’t be afraid to look at alternative pathways. The C4X pay is decent, but a degree is an investment.  I'd say seriously consider your options and don't rush into it.  Talk to current C4X regulars if you can. It’s a significant commitment, so do your homework!”"

- (If comment) Comment: “Oi, ACIDGOD47, that’s rough with the ACL. Wishing you a speedy recovery!  It’s a huge ask to transition to a frontline unit after surgery – the physio’s gonna be brutal. Definitely talk to your medic about the feasibility and timeline. Don’t force it if the knee’s not up to it.  Seriously, take it slow and listen to your body.  Good luck with the surgery!”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 95

- (If comment) Comment: “NoAbility1842, yeah, emart credits can be a pain, especially when you’re trying to manage your budget. Don’t get too hung up on the cap – it's usually pretty generous if you’re actually using the credits.  Just make sure you're regularly topping up and checking your account balance.  And yeah, the birthday top-ups are a nice bonus.  Don't stress too much – it’s just extra spending money.  Hope it helps!”

- (If comment) Comment: “Present-Pack-6139, man, I’m so sorry to hear you’re going through this. Losing muscle like that *sucks* – it's a massive confidence hit. It’s completely valid to feel depressed about it, especially with all the effort you've put in.  Have you considered talking to a healthcare professional about it? It's not weakness to seek support. Focus on small, achievable goals – like increasing protein intake and prioritizing sleep. Don’t beat yourself up about it; you’ve still got ORD to go! Sending you some positive vibes - don’t give up!”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 97
- Reason: This is a simple, relatable question about laundry facilities. It aligns with common NSmen concerns and provides a chance for practical advice.
- (If comment) Comment: “Open_Childhood5395, dude, you're not alone – laundry is a nightmare! Honestly, try using the laundromats near your base. They're usually pretty cheap and offer more options than the camp laundry. Don't get stressed about the blankets, they'll dry eventually. Just keep an eye on your laundry to make sure it doesn’t get stolen, haha”

- Action: ignore

- Reason: This is a very detailed and lengthy post. It's clearly a deeply considered decision, and the user is grappling with many potential concerns.

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey man, that sucks to hear about the ACL. Fingers crossed the surgery goes well and you can get back on your feet!  It's definitely a tough decision about the unit change – it’s great you're thinking about it carefully.  Do you know what the recovery timeline looks like from the surgery?  Might be worth checking with your doctor about what sort of physical therapy they recommend – that’ll be a key factor in your ability to transition to a frontline role. Good luck with the recovery!”

And yeah, they top up yearly on your birthday if you haven’t maxed out your points.  Just make sure you’re using them before they expire, man. Don't let them sit there!""

- Reason: This is a common issue and relates to logistics – something I'm interested in understanding better.
- (If comment) Comment: “Yeah, the camp laundry system is so unreliable. I tried to source some from outside, but finding decent quality ones is a pain.

Regarding the Up PES – it's a long shot, but don't give up!  They'll definitely consider your medical history, especially with a completed surgery. Keep the doctor updated on your recovery progress and don't be afraid to discuss your concerns. Good luck with the surgery, man!”

- (If comment) Comment: ""Hey OP, good question!  I was in the thick ones, so I can tell you it's mostly about utilising them for everyday stuff – laundry, canteen, etc.  There’s usually a cap, I think around 50-60 credits a month or something like that, depending on the scheme.  It really depends on your ORD timeline and what you're actually using them for.  Don't overspend, lah! Just use them for everyday stuff, man.  Hopefully, they'll top up regularly, but don't count on it, eh?”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 97
- Reason: This is a practical question about logistics during NS, which relates to my interests.
- (If comment) Comment: “Man, camp laundry is such a pain, right? I’ve heard you can sometimes get a few vendors to provide laundry services outside the camp, but they're usually more expensive. You could also look into dry cleaning services – they’re not as good as camp laundry, but it's better than nothing, yeah?”

**POST 94: Going for a surgery for my ACL, possible to Up pes to join a frontline combat unit**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 94
- Reason: This post hits on a very relatable NS concern – physical limitations and career progression. The emotional element of wanting to contribute and the uncertainty about future options makes it a good one to offer support and practical advice.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey ACIDGOD47, sorry to hear about the ACL. That's a huge setback. Getting surgery is a good first step.  It's definitely tough when you're facing limitations.  Regarding the Up PES, it’s a long shot, but don’t give up completely.  Talk to your unit’s medical officer *now* – get a clear assessment of your recovery timeline and functional capacity.  Ask specifically about the requirements for frontline vocations – they’ll be rigorous.  Don’t be afraid to ask for a second opinion, too.  Best of luck with the surgery, and keep us updated!”

**POST 95: How do emart credits work for nsmen?**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 95
- Reason: This is a practical, common question related to NS benefits.  It aligns with a desire for information and a realistic expectation of needing help navigating administrative processes.
- (If comment) Comment: “NoAbility1842, yeah, EMart credits can be a pain.  Honestly, there’s no *real* cap – they’ll just keep issuing credits as long as you’re an NSman.  The yearly top-ups are generally consistent, but it depends on your ORD date and the number of months you’re eligible.  If you’re ORDed early, you might not get as many.  It's worth checking with your ORD admin office for the specific details.  Don't stress too much, though – it’s just a bit of admin!”

- (If comment) Comment: “Present-Pack-6139, dude, I totally get where you're coming from. It’s so demoralizing when you put in the effort and don't see the results. Seriously, don't beat yourself up about it.  Make sure you’re getting enough protein, and don't go cutting out carbs completely—it'll just make you feel worse. Try and maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even if you're tired.  Small changes add up. Also, look at *why* you're losing mass – is it stress, hormones, lack of sleep? Talk to a doctor if you’re really struggling. You’ve got this, man, don’t let it get you down.""

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 94
- Reason: This post aligns directly with my interests in NS and operational roles. The ACL surgery creates a realistic and relatable scenario, and it's a genuine question. I can offer practical advice based on my understanding of the system.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey ACIDGOD47, good luck with the surgery – ACLs are brutal. It’s definitely possible to up PES after recovery, but it’ll be a long shot. The B4 PES with RMJ and knee issues will be a *huge* hurdle. You’ll need to demonstrate *significant* healing and a solid fitness level.  Talk to your platoon leader ASAP and get a clear assessment from the medical team.  Honestly, a Guards role would be far more realistic than a combat unit at this stage.  Don’t get your hopes up too high, but push for it – a strong medical report and demonstrating improved fitness could make a difference. Keep us updated on how it goes!”

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey NoAbility1842, good question! The credits top up yearly on your birthday *if* you're still an NSman. The cap seems to be around 200-300 credits per year, depending on your ORD date and usage. There are no limits if you’re still in NS.  Just make sure you’re using them within the year, or they’ll expire.  If you're in admin short and don't have reservist duties, you'll get a good chunk.  Don't be surprised if you don’t get *tons* – it's meant to cover small expenses, not a huge budget. Just keep an eye on your usage.”

The medics will be super strict on you. It’s great you're thinking ahead, but seriously, don't rush things. Focus on recovery first. Have you spoken to your unit commander about this?

- Reason: This post has a significant personal stake – ACL surgery and the possibility of Up PES. It aligns with the “personal stakes” criteria. The author is clearly seeking advice and it’s a relevant concern for many NSmen.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lao, that’s rough man! ACL is a pain.  Seriously though, Up PES after surgery is gonna be a tough call.  Depends on how quickly your knee heals and the doctors’ assessment, right?  Don’t rush things, you don't want to make it worse.  Ask your ME (Medical Officer) really specifically about your long-term prognosis *after* the surgery – like, how much movement you’ll be able to do, and what the risk of re-injury is.  Also, Guards Up PES is super competitive, so it’s not just about the knee.  Good luck bro, hope you recover fast!”

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, that's rough man. ACL tear during NS? Seriously though, talk to your medical officer *immediately* about this.  They'll need to assess the extent of the damage and how it impacts your mobility. Don't just assume you can Up PES just after surgery.

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, that’s rough, man.  Degrading to E1 is a real bummer.  COs can be a pain sometimes, especially if they're being unnecessarily strict.  You should really talk to your platoon leader or a senior NCO about it.

But there’s no cap on how many you can buy, assuming you keep your PES and stay in NS.  The key is to use your credits wisely. Don’t hoard them!

Honestly, you’re right to be worried – being posted into a combat unit without a proper psychological assessment is a major red flag.

Just be upfront with the instructors – don’t try to hide anything. Explain why you had the MCs, show them your medical notes. Most likely they'll just want to see if you can still perform basic exercises.  It’s more about demonstrating that you can handle the physical demands, not just clocking in the days.  Stay chill, eh?”"

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey OP, I had a similar issue when I was signing up for diff service. Basically, the FFI is a way to prove you’ve got the skills needed for the absorption.  I think it’s tied to your academic qualifications and whether you’ve done any relevant training (like a course in logistics or something).  I wouldn't just book an appointment like the MO said, because that's for BMT related stuff.  Try getting a detailed explanation from your unit admin, and if they’re not helpful, loop in your OCS.

The comment count suggests others have faced similar situations and are looking for advice.
- (If comment) Comment: “Yo, this is a major one.  ACLs are brutal, and getting your PES upgraded after a surgery is a real possibility, but it’s not guaranteed. Get a thorough assessment from the medical team – they’ll need to see how your knee is healing.  It's definitely worth pushing for, but be realistic.

Expect lots of drills, intense physical training, and a LOT of basic stuff. As for frontline vocations... girls *can* join the NDU and Commandos/Guards, although it might require exceptional physical fitness.  The SCS/OCS route is definitely a possibility after NS, but it's extremely competitive. Seriously think about your goals and what you're prepared for – it’s a big commitment.

This taps into a significant area of interest and potential anxiety, given the gender dynamics within NS. The questions are detailed and show a genuine level of research.
- (If comment) Comment: “Lazyleopard21, welcome to the conversation! Loads of questions, totally understandable. Seriously, don't be afraid to ask *lots* of questions.  Female routes *have* changed, and it's not a hard-and-fast rule that you'll *always* be going to combat. There are different vocations for women now, including some in support roles. It's a big shift from the past, so it’s good you’re asking about this. Don't expect everyone to have the same answers – that’s why you're here! The SCS/OCS thing is often hyped up, it’s not guaranteed. Really dig into the vocations available – some are amazing. And hey, if you *do* go combat, you'll be a rockstar! Seriously, keep asking! “

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 73
- Reason: This post directly asks about an FFI appointment, a common point of confusion for NSmen. It aligns with the user's interests in ‘form’, ‘pdo’, and ‘cost’ and the overall discussion around administrative processes in NS. The low number of comments suggests a genuine need for clarification.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey @Ok_Librarian_5173, yeah, FFIs can be a real pain to book. I had a similar thing happen last year.  Ask them to explain *why* they can’t book a normal one – there might be a specific reason that can be addressed. Also, don’t be afraid to push for a written explanation from them, it can be useful if you need to escalate it later.  Good luck getting this sorted!”

It’s totally reasonable to be asking about Upping PES after that.  I'd definitely explore the Guards route, especially given your RMJ – they’re more understanding of medical conditions.

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 73
- Reason: This is a direct question about a specific process (FFI) that seems confusing. My profile indicates an interest in ‘know’ and seeking information.  The low engagement suggests others might also find this confusing.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey man, FFI is basically your Fitness Proficiency Interview. It's like a test to see if you can meet the minimum fitness standards for NS. They’ll check your running, push-ups, sit-ups – the usual.  Don’t overthink it, just show up and try your best. Might be worth asking the MO for a clearer breakdown of what they're looking for. Good luck!”

- Post_ID: 94

- (If comment) Comment: “Ouch, sorry to hear about the ACL. That’s a major setback.  It's definitely possible to up PES after a successful surgery and rehab. But it will heavily depend on how quickly your knee heals and the medical clearance you get.  Speak to your medical officer ASAP about your plans and ask specifically about the criteria for moving to a combat unit after a knee injury.  Don’t rush it, gotta listen to the docs! Good luck with the surgery and recovery.  Hope you can get into a combat unit – it’s a tough but rewarding path.”

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey Ok_Librarian_5173, yeah, I remember struggling with the FFI appointments too.  I think it's worth pushing them on this, because if they’re saying it can't be book like a normal one, there might be a reason.

If it’s like a genuine, documented MC, they *should* pay out, but it's worth checking your MOMS to see what their policy is.  They might be strict, so getting confirmation in writing is crucial. Don’t assume – get it in writing! Also, don't be surprised if it’s prorated – that’s pretty standard. “"

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey Ok_Librarian_5173, I think the FFI is basically just a way to formalize the paperwork for your diff service.  I heard from a friend who signed up for an Operations Vocation.  They said you need to book it through the MO website or app.  It’s probably just a standard admin process.  Maybe give the MO a call again and specifically ask about the steps - don’t just ask about the ‘ffi appointment’ itself.”

- (If comment) Comment: “Yo MrKabowski, that's a good question.  It really depends on how your company structures their pay.  Since they’re registered and paying you directly, it shouldn't be service pay plus make-up pay.  I'd say double-check your employment contract or ask your HR to clarify.  It’s probably similar to how my company handles it.  Don't get stressed out, keep asking the questions!”

Regarding the PES move, it's *possible*, but honestly, a healed knee doesn't automatically guarantee a frontline role.  They'll assess your fitness and capabilities.  Focus on getting fully recovered - doing extra push-ups won’t help if your knee isn’t stable.  Talk to your medical officer about the specifics – don’t just assume.  Good luck with the surgery!”"

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey Ok_Librarian_5173, I’ve heard that getting the FFI can be a bit of a pain, man.  I think it's best to push your unit commander for clarification, like, don’t just accept the MO’s answer. They might have some insight into what's required.

The key thing here is how quickly you can recover, and what the docs say about your mobility.  Definitely chat to your unit commander *early* about this, and get them to advise you on what level of fitness you'll need to achieve. Don't just assume because you’re healed, you can jump straight into combat – needs to be a gradual process, lah!  Hope you recover quickly!"""

It's a critical, high-stakes question driven by a practical concern and reflects a realistic desire to transition into a combat role. It has a significant number of comments already, indicating some level of engagement.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wow, ACL and wanting to join the frontline, that’s a tough one, man.  RMJ is good, but the surgery and uping PES is a long shot, but not impossible.  Talk to your medical officer and your platoon leader. They'll need to assess your progress and your fitness after the surgery. Uping PES relies on getting your knee fully healed, plus demonstrating you’re still fit enough to handle the demands of a frontline role. It’s going to take a lot of effort and patience, so don’t get discouraged.  Just keep working on your recovery, and keep talking to your superiors. Good luck, man!”"

Uping PES after surgery depends a *lot* on the surgeon’s recommendation and how your knee heals.  Don’t push yourself too hard.  Speak to a medical officer ASAP – they'll be able to advise you on your PE assessment. Also, make sure you follow the medical officer's instructions carefully and don't try to rush things.  Good luck with the surgery!”"

It also taps into potential anxieties about transitions.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey Nocturnh, that’s a big question! I left after about 5 years as a signals specialist.

I was so stressed about the food at the start, but I just brought a few packets of instant noodles and some biscuits.  It’s better than nothing, and a lot of other guys do the same.

Don’t feel pressured to finish everything. They'll probably tell you to at least eat rice, and maybe some of the more palatable sides. Just don't feel bad about not finishing everything.  Seriously, don't force yourself to eat if you’re not hungry.  It’s better to be a little uncomfortable than to make yourself sick.  You can always top up your own food later, if you want.”

Honestly, OCS will be pretty demanding, and you’ll likely go through JCC as part of the training. As for the day-to-day, expect a mix of technical training, actually maintaining equipment, and probably a *lot* of paperwork. It's definitely not frontline, but you'll be crucial for keeping the whole operation running. The biggest con is it can be repetitive, so you’ll need to find ways to stay motivated.

- (If comment) Comment: “Wow, ACLs are a pain! Fingers crossed for a smooth recovery. It’s definitely possible to upskill after surgery, but it really depends on the type of surgery you had and your doctor’s recommendation.  Don’t force it, listen to your body.  Ask your unit medical officer for specific advice – they'll know the guidelines.  And seriously, make sure you’re 100% healed before you start pushing yourself. Safety first!”

- Reason: This post aligns perfectly with my profile – it's a detailed question about a specific career path (ME4) with multiple relevant sub-questions. The user is seeking genuine, unfiltered advice, and I can offer a realistic response.
- (If comment) Comment: “Hey PalpitationNovel8711, good question! ME4 is a solid choice – good job prospects after. OCS will be tough, definitely expect the JCC, it’s a rite of passage. As for the day-to-day, expect a mix of maintenance, potentially some basic engineering work, and a lot of paperwork. It can be pretty demanding, especially early on. The study sponsorship is generally seen as a good deal – the courses are relevant and can help you progress. Biggest downside is the workload – you’ll be on call a lot, and it’s not glamorous. Honestly, try to talk to some current ME4s if you can, get a real feel for what it’s like. Good luck with your decision!”

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey Odd-Bookkeeper-5747, sorry to hear about the fever! Teleconsult MC is a reasonable option, especially given the timing of your ippt.  It’s smart to question if a teleconsult is sufficient – they’ll want to assess the situation properly. Don't push it if they want to see you in person.  Regarding the TL role… honestly, most units are stretched for manpower, so don't feel pressured if you don't want to take it on. Just be upfront about that.  Good luck with the ippt - hope you can get it rescheduled!”

Speak to your medical officer *really* carefully about the timeframe and what’s realistically achievable. Don’t just assume you can jump straight into a frontline unit. It's good you’re questioning – most people are pretty cautious.  Good luck with the surgery, and prioritize getting back on your feet before thinking about career progression!”"

OCS for ME4s is pretty demanding, expect a lot of physical training and technical stuff. You'll definitely go through JCC as part of your training. As for the day-to-day, it’ll depend on your unit, but expect lots of maintenance work, troubleshooting, and potentially working with ammunition. It's a good mix of practical and theoretical.  Don’t get discouraged if it's tough - the system’s designed to push you.  Honestly, a lot of guys enjoy the technical side of it, especially if you're into problem-solving.

The post is well-structured with clear questions and seeks genuine opinions. It aligns well with my “legendary” and “new” interests, and the opportunity to gather real pros/cons is high value.
- (If comment) Comment: ""Hey PalpitationNovel8711, totally get the study sponsorship thing - it's a huge perk! OCS for ME4s can be pretty intense, yeah, and JCC is a must. Day-to-day for ME4s varies *a lot* depending on the specialization (Maintenance vs. Ammunition). Maintenance is generally more technical/engineering focused, while Ammunition is more about handling munitions. Honestly, don't just focus on the ""combat unit"" aspect – build a solid base of skills. The pros and cons are seriously about commitment – it's a long grind, but the skills you learn are valuable even after you’re out. Good luck with your decision!""

Getting to a polyclinic is your best bet for a proper assessment. Don't be afraid to be upfront with your unit about your fever and explain you can’t fulfil the ippt.

Don’t stress too much – talk to your ME first, see what the timeline looks like post-surgery and rehab.  They’ll be able to give you a more realistic assessment.

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, that's a tough situation bro. ACL tears are a pain, especially when trying to move up.  It's good you're asking early.  The key thing to discuss with your unit commander *now* is the timeline of your recovery and what the expectations are for fitness standards post-surgery. Don't just assume you can jump straight into frontline after the operation.  Get a solid plan on when you'll be cleared for training, and whether the unit can accommodate a slower progression.

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, this is a classic question man. Seriously, the closest you can get is maybe a specialist role within a medical unit.  Transferring out as a medic is *super* tough, even with good reasons.  It's all about needing specific skills they can’t easily replace.  Don’t stress too much, but yeah, it’s a big commitment.  Good luck, bro!”

**POST 31:** ""Do ME3s get a sword or only ME4 above?""

- (If comment) Comment: “Interesting! Saw something similar during NDP rehearsals too.  Yeah, ME3s usually have the pace stick and sword for colour parties. It’s a bit of a tradition.  Don’t expect to be swinging it around like in the movies, lah.  It’s more for show and symbolising the unit.”

**POST 94:** ""Going for a surgery for my ACL, possible to Up pes to join a combat unit""

It directly addresses potential concerns about physical limitations and career progression – aligning perfectly with the ""quality"" and “support” interests, and the user’s experience with bullying speaks to a common struggle.  The multiple comments show it's generating discussion.
- (If comment) Comment: “Ouch, that sucks man! ACL is a nightmare.  It's good you're being proactive about your recovery and asking about this.  It's *possible*, but the docs will be very cautious.  After surgery and full recovery, they’ll assess your fitness level and the unit's needs.  Uping Pes will depend on your strength, mobility, and how well you perform during assessments.

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, man, this is a classic! Honestly, most medics are pretty stuck in their units, especially after BMT.  It’s mostly because of the specialised training and the unit's reliance on their medical skills. You’ll likely be tied to your unit for the whole time. Don't stress too much about it though, plenty of medics go on to do awesome stuff later.”

**POST 31:** “Do ME3s get a sword or only ME4 above?”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 31
- Reason: This is a direct, relatable question about a specific aspect of NS, especially concerning ME3s. It plays into the user's interest in 'cameras' and ‘tech’ and the question is very specific.
- (If comment) Comment: “Yo, good question! I remember seeing some ME3s with pace sticks and swords during NDP rehearsals. Officially, swords are mostly for commissioned ME4s and above.  It’s more of a symbolic thing for ME4s, you know?  Don't go overthinking it.”

**Post 31:**

- (If comment) Comment: “Oi, that’s a tough one. ACL’s a serious issue, so it’s good you’re getting surgery. Getting back into combat after this depends on how your knee heals and what the doctors say. Don’t push it too early, man.  Talk to your MC, get a proper assessment, and see what your options are.

- Reason: This post taps into the common anxieties around ME vocations.  The TikTok clip makes it feel more relevant and relatable. It involves a question about a specific vocation (""sword"") and therefore fits my 'cameras' and 'devices' interests.
- (If comment) Comment: “Dude, I saw a clip of that too!  Yeah, the colour party with swords is a thing, especially during NDP.  It’s a bit weird, right?  Honestly, ME3s rarely get swords – it's more the ME4s and above that handle them.  Don't read too much into it though - just part of the NDP drill.”

- Reason: The post concerning ACL surgery and unit transfers is highly relevant, given my ‘nas’, ‘server’, and ‘network’ interests (a significant injury impacts a person's ability to function in a unit).  It’s a serious question that touches on a key issue for many NSmen.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wow, that’s a tough situation. ACL injuries are really common, unfortunately.  It's good you’re asking about the possibility of transitioning to a combat unit.  It's definitely possible, but the key will be your recovery. Make sure you have a solid medical clearance and follow your doctor’s advice carefully.  It sounds like you’re in Supply, so a good rehab plan is critical.  Good luck with the surgery and the recovery - that’s a big step towards getting back on your feet.”

- Reason: The post regarding dreading ICT is incredibly relatable. My user profile includes interests like ‘home’ and ‘main’, which often reflect the anxieties and frustration of facing difficult mandatory tasks.  It's a genuine emotional expression and a good fit for my commenting style (average length, a bit of sentiment).
- (If comment) Comment: “Seriously, ICT is the WORST. Like, why do we even HAVE ICT? It's so pointless. I totally get the feeling – it's just a grind, and seeing everyone else enjoying their time in unit makes it even worse.  It's good you were able to defer – that's a huge relief.  Don't let it get you down too much.  Just power through, and then you can forget about it!”"

- (If comment) Comment: “Hey man, this is a good question. Unit transfers can be tricky, especially when you've got RMJ. The key thing to remember is to talk to your sector commander *early* and be really clear about your reasons. They’ll likely want to hear about any medical reasons or things that are impacting your performance. Don't just assume it's possible – get their feedback first. Good luck!”

- Action: comment

- Reason: This post is asking about ME3 sword allocation - a classic NS question! It taps into a common concern about progression and units.
- (If comment) Comment: “Yeah, I remember seeing some ME3s with pace sticks during NDP, it's a bit of a weird thing. Honestly, it’s usually just ceremonial, but good to check, especially if you’re aiming for a Combat Vocation later. Keep an eye on your sector commander's feedback – that's what will actually matter.”

- (If comment) Comment: “Woah, that’s rough. Seriously, dealing with a medical issue *and* the potential fallout from NS is a massive headache. It’s totally understandable you're feeling this way. Don’t just suck it up – you’ve got a right to speak up about your concerns.

**POST 30:** “Whats is one unit in SAF you cant transfer out of as a medic?”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 30
- Reason: This is a very common and practical question for someone new to NS. It aligns with the “help” and “new” topics of interest. The low engagement (5 comments, 0 likes) suggests people are genuinely seeking information.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lao, man, this is a classic NS question! Honestly, you can't transfer out of a medical unit once you're assigned. It's super tightly controlled.  You'll be attached to your unit’s medical team for the duration of your NS.  It’s a pain, but it's how it works. You can talk to your sector commander if you’re really struggling with the situation, but don't expect a miracle.”

**POST 31:** “Do ME3s get a sword or only ME4 above?”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 31
- Reason: This is a straightforward, specific question that many ME3s would be asking. It fits the “new” topic and the desire for practical NS knowledge.
- (If comment) Comment: “Yeah man, ME3s get the pace stick and sword during NDP rehearsals. It's part of the Colour Party.  ME4s and above get the full gear, but it’s a cool thing to see, especially during the parade. Hopefully you get to experience it!""

**POST 94:** “Going for a surgery for my ACL, possible to Up pes to join a combat unit”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 94
- Reason: This post has a surprisingly high number of comments (61), indicating it’s generating significant discussion. The poster is directly asking for advice, a key element of the subreddit’s purpose, and the request relates directly to NS pathways – hugely relevant.  It also has emotional stakes as the user is concerned about their career progression.
- (If comment) Comment: “Dude, that’s a huge ask, but it's definitely possible!  A healed ACL is a massive plus. You'll have to go through the Up PES process, which involves a medical assessment to determine if you’re fit for combat.  They'll look at your recovery time, your medical report, and your performance during training. It's not guaranteed, but a successful surgery and good recovery will give you a strong case. Speak to your sector commander and ask for a referral to the medical officer – they'll guide you through the process.  Good luck man, sending you positive vibes!”

**POST 32:** “Why am I dreading ICT even without attending?”

- Action: ignore
- Post_ID: 32
- Reason: This is a ""Discussion"" post, and while it has some personal content, the engagement is low (2 comments), suggesting it's not a trending topic. Given my profile indicates a focus on practical NS issues, this leans towards a more personal and less actionable post."

**POST 30:** ""Whats is one unit in SAF you cant transfer out of as a medic?""

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 30
- Reason: This is a very common and relevant question, and the low number of comments (6) suggests it hasn't gotten much traction. My profile indicates interest in ‘brand’ and ‘camera’ (although somewhat tenuously applied to NS), and I can offer a realistic perspective based on my understanding of unit culture.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, man, that’s a legit question! I think it’s probably the Combat Support Units (CSU). They're pretty specialized and tied to specific medical roles.  Transferring out would be super difficult cuz of the training and equipment. You’ll need to seriously chat with your medic officer – they'll be the best source of info. Don’t be shy to ask, bro!”


**POST 31:** ""Do ME3s get a sword or only ME4 above?""

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 31
- Reason: This post taps into a commonly discussed topic – ME3s and the sword. The low number of comments (6) means it’s likely an unaddressed question. It aligns with my interest in ‘brand’ (referencing the ME’s gear), and I can provide a reasonable answer.
- (If comment) Comment: “Dude, good question! I think it depends on the colour party and the specific training they’re doing. ME3s get the pace stick and the sword *sometimes*, especially during NDP rehearsals or exercises. It’s more for show and ceremonial purposes. ME4s and above are more consistently issued with full combat gear.  Don't overthink it – it’s a bit of a cool factor.”

**POST 94:** ""Going for a surgery for my ACL, possible to Up pes to join a combat unit""

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 94
- Reason: This post immediately resonates with my profile’s interests in ‘brand’ (implied by needing gear for a combat unit) and the significant number of comments (62) indicate it’s a central discussion point. It's a very realistic scenario and a critical question for someone considering a career change after recovery.
- (If comment) Comment: ""Aiyah, bro, that's tough, but it's *possible*. You need to show the docs your surgery report and get your knee cleared by the medical officer.  It's going to be a *huge* uphill battle, you'll need to really convince them of your fitness.  Don't give up!  Focus on getting your knee strong and stable.  Good luck with the surgery – hope it heals well!""

**POST 32:** ""Why am I dreading ICT even without attending?""

- Action: ignore
- Post_ID: 32
- Reason: This is a ‘Discussion’ post and the low number of comments (2) indicates it's not a widely discussed topic. The content suggests a personal experience of bullying, which is a sensitive area but doesn’t align with my stated interests, and I’ll avoid getting involved in a potentially emotionally charged conversation. It's better to let this one fade."

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lao, this is a classic question! Honestly, most medics are tied to their base hospitals.  It's super rare to get transferred out, especially after you’ve settled in.  The biggest thing is usually about the type of hospital you’re attached to – like, some might be more trauma-focused, others are more general.  It's best to talk to your Platoon Sergeant or a Senior Medic to get the real lowdown, yeah?”

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 30
- Reason: This is a very common question, particularly for ME3s and ME4s considering their future careers. It aligns with my ""camera"" and ""model"" interests as it’s a core part of understanding a career path in the SAF. Plus, the low engagement suggests a genuine, unaddressed need for information.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, this is a classic question, bro. Most ME3s will always be stuck in their colour party unit, man. It's the colour party unit that you join, and that's pretty much where you'll be for your entire NS, unless you do some real luck and get transferred.  Seriously, talk to your platoon leader or senior NCO about this – they'll give you the best advice. Don’t just ask Reddit, lah!”

**POST 31:** “Do ME3s get a sword or only ME4 above?”

- (If comment) Comment: “Yeah, saw that clip too! Pretty cool to see the ME3s with the swords. Officially, yeah, it’s mostly ME4s and above. But sometimes, for NDP, they might pull out a few for effect. Don’t get your hopes up for a frontline position though, lah.  It’s just a display.”

The high number of comments (64) indicates a strong interest and potential for helpful advice. It’s a crucial query for someone navigating a medical issue within NS.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wah, good luck with the surgery, bro. ACLs are a pain. It’s definitely possible to pursue a combat role *after* your recovery, but it's going to depend on your post-op progress and your PES.

It also aligns with my interest in ‘authenticity’ and ‘fake’ – is this a genuine observation or a misinterpreted trend?
- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, saw that too!  I think it's possible they were using some sort of prop sword for the NDP rehearsals, man.  They usually don't give all ME3s real swords, right?

- (If comment) Comment: “Ugh, that sounds awful! Seriously, those bumps are the worst. I had a similar thing happen when I was in 2SG. It was likely from the friction and sweat.  I found that using a good emollient (like Vaseline) helped immensely. Also, make sure you're thoroughly cleaning and drying your legs after training.

I don’t know exactly how much influence you have, but it’s worth politely and formally requesting a review with your unit commander.

Since you failed the IPPT, it’s probably even *more* important to get a leave application in.  Don’t give up, keep pushing for it.  And seriously, try to do your best on the next one - they tend to be tough.""

The uni thing is a valid concern, but the ME1 eligibility is more about your overall performance and how well you do in the assessments, not just your past social skills. They’ll be looking for evidence of your ability to handle the rigors of NS.  Don’t let your self-doubt hold you back.  Just focus on doing your best, and you’ll have a better chance of progressing.   And don’t worry about never having a leadership position – they'll assess your leadership potential on the ground and will give you feedback. Just show them you’re willing to learn.”"

**Post 1:**

- Action: ignore
- Post_ID: 5
- Reason: This post is incredibly inappropriate and focuses on a potentially offensive and irrelevant topic. It deviates significantly from the typical NSSG discussion and violates community guidelines regarding respectful behaviour.  It’s a low-effort, potentially harmful post.
- (If comment) Nvm.  Seriously, this is a weird question.  Let's focus on actual NS stuff, yeah?

**Post 2:**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 5
- Reason: This is a genuine question about GPMG course experience and seeks advice – fits the criteria for a potentially viral post. The user is clearly struggling, and it’s a common concern for those entering specialist vocations.
- (If comment) Hey Enough_Bumblebee_296, that's a tough course! ITI's GPMG course can be pretty demanding, especially learning the mechanics.  The day-to-day would be a lot of practical drills, and yes, there's definitely overnight outfield training. The schedule *is* strict; expect early mornings and late nights.  Good luck!  Don't be afraid to ask questions – most instructors are happy to help.

**Post 3:**

- Action: comment
- Post_ID: 6
- Reason:  This post is seeking advice regarding applying for leave in Pobc.  It is a relevant question that aligns with typical NS concerns and seeks practical advice, making it a good candidate for engagement.
- (If comment) Own-Hyena8973, applying for leave during Pobc is tricky. Because you’re in Pobc, chances are slim. It is better to apply for leave *after* you've settled in, and make sure you've addressed your Ippt failure first.  Explain your circumstances clearly and honestly –  it's more likely to be approved if you show you’re taking responsibility.  Don't be bummed about the Ippt – everyone makes mistakes.

**Post 4:**

- Action: ignore
- Post_ID: 7
- Reason: This is a very vague question with a negative sentiment (didn't pass Ippt). The lack of specifics and the expressed disappointment make it a low-effort post and doesn’t seem to be aiming for helpful advice.

- Comment: “Hey Enough_Bumblebee_296, GPMG courses are pretty demanding – expect a lot of theoretical learning alongside practical training. Overnight outfield drills are common, and the schedule *is* strict, especially during the first and last parades. Expect a lot of time spent on weapon handling and maintenance. You'll be working with a small team, so teamwork and communication are key.  You’ll likely be going through lots of paperwork too – GPMG training requires a LOT of meticulous record-keeping.

- Comment: ""Own-Hyena8973, sorry to hear about the IPPT! It's a killer.  Applying for leave during POBC is tricky – they're usually very strict. It's *possible* but you'll need a very compelling reason, like genuine family emergencies or important exams.  Don't expect it to be easy, and be prepared to provide loads of documentation.  POBC is a good time to apply for leave if you can. Just be realistic about the chances and start the application process ASAP, because the longer you wait, the lower your chances will be.  You can try to explain your situation to your officer to see if there’s any chance, but don’t be surprised if they say no."""

There’s definitely no cap on how many you can buy, but I think you can only use them for Emart purchases. And yeah, if you *don’t* have reservist, you'll still get the yearly top-ups. Just make sure you keep track of your balances, or you’ll end up with a whole bunch of unused credits, ah?”

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, that’s rough man. ACLs are a pain, especially when you’re trying to move up.  It’s good you’re exploring the options after the surgery.  Seriously though, don’t get your hopes up too high – frontline units are super competitive. But good luck with the surgery!  Hope you recover quickly and strong, bro.”

- (If comment) Comment: “Yeah man, those credits are a lifesaver, aren't they?  I've been hoarding them for snacks, lol.  Just check the FAQ on the EMart website – they usually have a breakdown of how it works. Basically, you get credits based on your reservist cycles and unit activities.  Don’t worry too much, just use them wisely!”

- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lau, that’s rough man. ACL’s a killer, especially when you’re aiming for frontline.  Seriously, hope your surgery goes well and you bounce back strong.  It's tough balancing the desire to serve with physical limitations.  Have you spoken to your ME about the potential impact on your vocation? Maybe talk to a couple of Guards guys to get a feel for the practicalities – the training can be *very* different than Supply.  Good luck, bro!”

Honestly, just keep an eye on your reservist cycle – that's how it changes. Ask your unit admin if you are not sure. Don’t be shy to ask!  Hope you can get more shorts, they're definitely handy.”

- Reason: The post has a clear, relatable dilemma – someone with a serious medical issue (ACL tear) trying to transition to a combat role. This aligns with the emotional depth and specific question aspect. My profile focuses on NS experiences, and providing advice in this situation is directly relevant.
- (If comment) Comment: “Wah lao, that’s tough man. ACL tear is a major setback, especially if you’re aiming for frontline.  It's definitely possible to try, but the surgery and recovery would need to be *really* solid before even considering up-pes.  Talk to your medical officer and a sports physician - they’ll be able to give you a realistic assessment of your knee’s strength and your ability to handle the physical demands of a combat unit. Don’t push it too early, bro.  Good luck with the surgery!”

- Reason: This is a straightforward question about Emart credits, and the low engagement (only 20 comments) suggests it's unlikely to become a major discussion. My profile indicates occasional posting, so engaging in this type of casual question isn't a priority.

- Reason: This post highlights a common concern - reservist outfield requirements and potentially restrictive CO/OC directions. It’s a relatable situation reflecting a possible frustrating experience.
- (If comment) Comment: “Siao liao, man.  Hearing that about the CO and OC being ‘garang’ is super frustrating. It's always a battle getting information about outfield requirements. Just make sure to document *everything* – get it in writing from your CO about the restrictions, and keep a record of all communications.  It’s better to have a clear record if things change later on.”"
