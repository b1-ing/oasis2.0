{"timestamp": "2025-08-20T02:23:50.436860", "num_posts": 276, "model_response": "Based on the provided \"viral\" posts and the general content of the r/NationalServiceSG community, here are the features that appear to make posts go viral:\n\n1.  **High Emotional Resonance & Vulnerability:**\n    *   **Examples:** Post 91 (\"Advice on what to do for my mental state\"), Post 94 (\"Iâ€™m just feeling so damn lost as a Soon-To-Be 3SG\").\n    *   **Why it works:** Posts that share raw, personal struggles, especially related to mental health, isolation, or overwhelming pressure, tend to elicit strong empathy and a desire from the community to offer support, advice, or share their own similar experiences. People connect with genuine human struggle.\n\n2.  **Highly Relatable Dilemmas or Universal NS Experiences:**\n    *   **Examples:** Post 92 (\"Regret putting yes for command school\"), Post 95 (\"ICT (High Key) at Kranji Camp 3. What to expect\").\n    *   **Why it works:** These posts tap into common crossroads, anxieties, or shared experiences that a large portion of the NS community (both current NSFs and NSmen) has either faced, is currently facing, or will likely face. Questions about key phases (BMT, ICT, command school) or major decisions (signing on, PES changes) resonate broadly.\n\n3.  **Seeking Specific, Practical Advice for Significant Problems:**\n    *   **Examples:** All four viral posts (91, 92, 94, 95) are framed as questions seeking help or information.\n    *   **Why it works:** The community thrives on helping each other navigate the complexities of NS. Posts that clearly articulate a problem and ask for actionable advice or detailed expectations (e.g., about specific camps, courses, or medical processes) are more likely to attract numerous replies from those with relevant experience.\n\n4.  **Specificity within a Broad Category:**\n    *   **Example:** Post 95 is very specific (\"ICT (High Key) at Kranji Camp 3\") rather than just \"What is reservist like?\".\n    *   **Why it works:** While general topics have wide appeal, hyper-specific questions about common camps, vocations, or scenarios can become \"anchor\" posts for anyone searching for that exact information. It makes the question highly relevant to a smaller, but very engaged, subset of users who *have* that experience.\n\n5.  **Addressing \"Taboo\" or Stigmatized Topics Openly:**\n    *   **Examples:** Mental health struggles (Post 91, 94) are often stigmatized, but when discussed openly, they foster a supportive environment.\n    *   **Why it works:** By breaking the silence on difficult subjects, these posts create a safe space for others to chime in, share, and offer solidarity, which can lead to a surge in engagement.\n\nIn summary, viral posts on r/NationalServiceSG often combine **vulnerability, relatability, and a clear request for assistance or information** regarding core NS experiences, especially those that touch on personal well-being or major life decisions within the service.", "post_ids": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276]}
