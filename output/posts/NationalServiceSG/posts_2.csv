I've been feeling troubled mentally so I decided to visit the nearest polyclinic. After a short consultation with the doctor, they said that my symptoms point towards a panic attack disorder. They gave me a referral to a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis but the earliest date they could book for me coincides with the day that I'll be in Tekong (confinement period, which is late this month).

Will I even be able to show up? I don't think I can change the date that easily because this kind of thing is scheduled months ahead. The doctor suggested that if I really want a diagnosis ASAP and declare before I enlist, I'll have to go private. I'm thinking of following that advice but I don't know if it's any better. AFAIK the only downside to it is that my enlist date will be pushed back right? I don't really mind.

I heard if people declare during confinement they'll have to be excused from showing up or sit out some activities, all that stuff. It sounds troublesome‚Äîmakes me think I should just follow the doctor's advice so that I won't have to worry about any complications while I serve. Because if they delay my enlist date, everything will be sorted out by then right? Again, I don't know what's best so I'm really hoping to get some answers/opinions

TL;DR Facing mental health issues, not sure whether to get + declare my diagnosis after I enlist to avoid complicating things while in camp"
100,How David Neo's Son Case played out actually makes me Happy,JiPaiHongGanLiao,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1mfcw9n/how_david_neos_son_case_played_out_actually_makes/,130,0,65,0,2025-08-02T00:30:47Z,Discussion,"[Previous context and history. -- Reddit Tread posted on July 14th '25](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/what_happened_to_the_case_of_david_neos_son/)

Firstly, I want to be clear that I bear no hate, resentment or any feelings towards David Neo. This is not about him specifically, it is a reflection into the system.

**I am a farmer.**  I grew up believing that hard work will get you somewhere, And of course, you must play your cards right. Like many of you, I did not have a father who was somebody. \[In fact if you didn't know your father, that does make your father as a nobody\]. I believe in meritocracy. Unfortunately, with how small Singapore is, and how everyone is related to one another, it can be hard to hold this value. You do feel a big sense of nepotism looming in the country. Whether that is true or not, I cannot comment on that. I am a farmer. 

 [There is a comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/comment/n36tpzd/)in the tread that asks if the son made it to command school. That specific comment was answered with saying that the son did not make it into command school. Further replies speculated that the son did not pass IPPT as the definite reason. 

Whether was it because of the incident, or because of IPPT, I am happy. I am happy not because of the former chief of army's son did not make it to a command school, but because the system is working as it should be. 

A couple of years ago, Winston Choo, who was the first CDF, attended his grandson's officer commissioning ceremony.  [This was reported by mothership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02B1AYrV8w). There were a few comments that hinted at nepotism and it was ""given to him"". As quoted from one:

&gt;Everyone knew he'd be an officer way before he even entered NS. Imagine the chief of defence's grandson not being a decorated soldier. His commanders were all probably too scared of doing anything to him.

It is easy to draw lines. And maybe more so that CDF is higher ranking then CoA. But CoA isn't some small time position either. So I show happiness, not because of the underachievement of someone, but because it is testament to my belief. The belief of meritocracy.

On the sideline I also wonder: what kind of pressure do the descendants of these high flyers face to perform, being involuntarily linked to that legacy. 

Oh, and &gt;!because I said I am a farmer,  I[ do enjoy farming videos. ](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSSUEmdGL/)As the saying goes:  ËÄÅÂ∏àÊúâÁ©øË°£ÊúçÔºåÊàëÂ∑Æ‰∏ÄÁÇπËÆ§‰∏çÂá∫ËÄÅÂ∏à‰∫ÜÔºÅÔºÅ!&lt;"

You won't do IPPT but you'll still do Foot drills and prepare for POP Parade and Rescue Training. As for punishment s you'll write lines that's about it. Some days will be chill and some days will be shag but you gotta remember to count yourself lucky that you're not in Tekong training.

Try to not isolate yourself and dread over the month ah cause trust me you won't enjoy BRT if you do that instead socialise and get to know your bunkmates, your platoonmates and your Sgts, Enciks and Sirs ah. BRT was fun for me and I made alot of memories with them.

Lastly, since BRT is only gonna be a month, try not to MC or RSO cause really it's only a month and the time passes really fast and you'll miss out ah.

Theres more details regarding my background but i dont wanna disclose here so pm me if you can help me thanks!

Basically i just have a few questions regarding how to get out of mono guards and get into a not so xiong vocation.

Questions:
1) Is guards one of the toughest vocation in saf that you can get posted too? If not what other vocation is tougher that everyone can get posted too?
2) Do everyone that is in mono guards bmt get sent back to unit? If not how many do get posted out and to where?
3) What methods are there to get out of mono guards?
4) What are the conditions you need to pass bmt so you do not need to rebmt?
5) What is recovery coy all about?
6) What the difference between temp downpes and perma downpes and how do they differentiate them?
7) Is private psychiatrist memo and pcc memo the same as i cant wait to see the pcc as it in about 5 weeks later"

- Certain SAFPU or SPF units offer early exposure to real-world enforcement work (looks decent on a resume).
- Cybersecurity vocations now actually give you access to real training certifications like CompTIA.

I was keen to explore more on cyber defence and security thus applying for the role. I have my MAPAS test and interview scheduled next week. However, upon speaking with the recruiter, he mentioned that I should apply for MIE instead due to my lack of experience.

I looked at the role and realised that the trainee and actual pay was very low, and progression doesnt seem that good especially going in as ME1. Should I still attempt to go for the interview for C4X or should I just cancel the interview to not waste my time and their time?

Context: I'm currently pes b1 doing bmt, I have diagnosed gout and am xurrently on medication for it however sometimes due to circumstances, be it a tight schedule or some other issues I do not take the medication resulting in a gout flare which pretty much cripples me for a few days till I can walk properly again, secondly I also have a kidney issues where one side is slightly smaller than the other causing it to overwork and leak protein into my urine which would result in that kidney ""dying"" quicker than an average one, therefore I started telmisartan for that issue, however that medication has started causing me headaches and lightheadedness that I did not feel before taking that medication. Lastly I had an old Achilles injury from basketball on my right leg that I did not declare before entering as I wanted to try and go throught the whole bmt experience, however after doing outfield, my Achilles injury started acting up quite a bit after being in boots for so long which made me limp from place to place. Can I get some advice as on what to do and if I even have a chance to down pes? As I've gone for medical review and the doctors seem ABIT hesitant as to whether or not I can. As much as Ive been enjoying my experience in bmt so far I'm not to sure how far my body can go until it breaks down, to add on I'm part of mono guards which means I'll be doing gvt or GCC depending on my posting and truthfully I'm not planning to sign on so I do not want to risk my health just for two years of ns.

Previously when I did my body check up at CMPB, the result came short by 0.2 from the acceptable haemoglobin range, and at PTMC, the new result drop quite a bit but as mentioned, I do not feel any of the symptoms.

The other contributing factor that correlates to low haemoglobin could be low iron count. My general diet doesn‚Äôt include much of red meat or high iron diet.

The MO told me to go to a Polyclinic to get some iron supplements and would have to down pes me due to my low blood count.

Ok so I have this thing called Precordial catch syndrome. Basically the symptoms are random bouts of sharp intensive pain at the left side of the chest. This has never really been that big of a trouble for me. But recently, I'd say for the past 3-4 months or so, it has been happening more and more frequently. The durations of these waves of pain vary from like a couple seconds to whole ass 15mins of just constant pain and worrying that my heart is gonna explode. I'm not really sure what caused the frequency of it to increase over the past few months but my theory is that its a mix of me getting back into excercising and also random bouts of panic attacks causing my breathing to increase and hence causing this ?? Regarding all this I have a few questions ... Precordial catch syndrome is said to be harmless but honestly the pain is super unbearable, I have to literally grip my chest and take shallow breaths to try and control it and any movement I make seem to exaggerate the pain. Question is, do I declare this when I go in ?? I'm scared that they will say since its a harmless thing that I should just bare with it and then it happening to me when I'm excercising or anything. TLDR IM JUST REALLY SCARED. I know it's harmless ... but man does it feel good to basically go through a mini heart attack every now and then ...

Any advice tips is appreciated !! Thnks for taking ur time to read this üôè"
