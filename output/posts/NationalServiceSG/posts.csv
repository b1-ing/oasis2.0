98,Signing on to C4X? Worth it or not,Fred-ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1m3y4n1/signing_on_to_c4x_worth_it_or_not/,80,0,56,0,2025-07-19T14:52:05Z,Question,"Hi guys, I have yet to enter the force (waiting to be enlisted), but I am considering signing on to C4X since signing is best done during BMT, from what I have heard. I have read posts regarding signing on but they are about 3 years ago, so I'd like to gain a newer/fresher insight on the current state.  
  
Let me list out some of my concerns regarding signing on to C4X, hopefully any ex-regulars, current regulars of C4X, or even other vocation regulars could share their experience, stories or advice regarding this decision.

Pros:  
  
1. Sign-on bonus  
  
2. University tuition is paid for fully (this to me is somewhat of a concern, because my GPA will definitely not land me in NUS (yes I tried, my GPA (Dip in CyberSec) + Certs + Personal Projects + Extra-Curricular activities + Work Experience), SIT is my only hope. So if SIT rejects me, I would have no choice but to study private/overseas uni if I want to attain a Degree. My parents specifically told me that if I were to study overseas or private, I would be paying for the fees myself.  
  
3. Decent starting pay post uni (from what I heard about $5K base/starting pay for uni graduates), and will only increase with promotions. Not sure if there is risk pay for C4X.

4. Career and Financial stability, in terms of, I won't just get fired out of nowhere. (Unless I make a serious mistake, and the fact that I can continue my position even after my bond ends)

5. C4X aligns with my career path and studies, so I would assume that with the work that I would be doing in C4X, it would minimally provide me with beneficial knowledge/experiences/skillsets that are transferrable into the private sector, be it soft-skills or hard-skills.

6. Regular pay during my 2 year mandatory service

Cons:

1. 6 year bond, so when im out of SAF, im already 32. Meaning im tied to SAF for about the next 10-12 years or so, no room for regrets

2. Heard about the toxic work culture regarding superiors and regulars, but im not sure if it is as rampant in C4X

3. Potentially thrown into some sai kang BS role, which will provide me with absolutely nothing in value

  
For some context, I don't really mind going through OCS to become occifer, if it is part of the requirement as a sign-onee then so be it.   
  
I have also worked at a private sector company before, doing cyber related work. It is just 9 hours a day x5 every week (office / WFH), I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a mixture of boring/super-stressful, I would say that (in my opinion), most of the full timers there are overworked, juggling 7 concurrent projects at once with super tight deadlines.

Edit: Also how are leaves and holidays like? Am I tied to Singapore in the long run or can I take leave for travels etc. as well?"
99,Worried I'm losing my bf while he's in NS,Fluid_Zombie_6197,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1m3xi25/worried_im_losing_my_bf_while_hes_in_ns/,133,0,89,0,2025-07-19T14:24:59Z,Discussion,"Hi everyone! For context, my bf and I started our LDR since before he started NS (I'm from a different country), and we've visited each other IRL a few times. Our relationship has been stable and healthy for the most part.

During BMT, he made a lot of effort to call and text me whenever possible and give a lot of assurance, even though his schedule was packed. During weekend book outs we could spend almost the entire time together, and I would listen to try to understand the NS workings since I myself am not from Singapore haha.

Fast forward to after BMT, he's in infantry and now spends almost 0 time with me. From my understanding he's around the same levels of busy as before, yet he spends much less time with me now. When confronted, he just told me that he has more friends and is getting along well with the sergeants, so he enjoys his time much more now with friends like ordering out and spending bookouts with them.

Thing is, he can go a full 24 hours without texting me, sometimes won't call, always saying it's past lights out by the time he's free. During weekends he spends more time going out with friends and family and doing tasks like getting a haircut or buying things he needs for NS. And whatever free time he has in between all of that goes to watching youtube or playing games. 

Usually, I wouldn't mind these things, but the change is so abrupt and sudden that it raises room for suspicion. He literally made an entire personality change within 1 week of entering infantry. Sometimes we're only spending 5 minutes per day talking to each other (text/call). And sometimes on weekends we may only spend 8 hours together (for sleep call - so we're not even talking).

I considered he may be cheating. He told me once that he was envious of his other friends who got to go out on actual dates with their gfs during bookout on night/weekend (since we can't, I'm not in SG). But he's told me he has me as his lockscreen and all his platoon and sergeants know about us dating. He's also told his parents and siblings. I also don't think he has the balls to cheat to be honest. I have access to contact his closest friends and family to ask, but haven't in case I'm just overreacting.

I'm overall just afraid that the lack of quality time may completely dwindle the relationship, especially as it is LDR where consistent communication is key. I think I myself may also start losing passion in the relationship as I spend so much more time on myself and my friends/colleagues compared to him. To me it almost feels like I have no boyfriend except for an hour a day, especially when my love language is quality time.

Any advice/opinions would be great, especially from girlies who are also dating recruits!

Edit: there are so many sickos in my DMs asking me if I wanna cheat on him. Get a grip bruhh 😭

Edit 2: For clarification, I'm not in SG Uni and I'm working corporate from a different country. yes I'm older than him haha"

Hi everyone,
I’m currently quite stressed and confused about my NS situation and hoping someone here might have gone through something similar or can offer advice.

Here’s my situation:
	•	Enlisted into Enhanced BMT as a PES B1 recruit (combat-fit)
	•	After 5 days, I sought help from CareHub, then saw my MO, and received 3 days of Respite MC
	•	Was later sent to IMH A&amp;E, received a memo, and submitted it to my unit
	•	I was told I’ll be referred to PCC (Psychiatric Case Conference), but I’ve yet to get any confirmation on my appointment
	•	Currently, I’m:
	•	Awaiting OOC
	•	Still PES B1 (MO has not down-PESed me)
	•	On Light Duties (84 days)
	•	Excused Stay-In (temporary)
	•	Excused FLEGS
	•	Still allowed to take Respite MCs when needed

My main concern is this:
Will I be posted into a combat vocation unit before I get to see PCC or before they down-PES me? Since I’m still technically PES B1 and not officially downpassed yet, I’m really scared I might end up getting posted before proper psychiatric evaluation happens."

I have no brothers and my father attended NS awhile ago, so it would be great if I could get some answers to my questions 😊

1.	⁠If I were to sign on, should I apply for university first, then sign on via the Mindef website, if no, what is the proper pathway I should take while approaching this?
2.	⁠In the 2 years of NS, what will I experience other than BMT?
3.	⁠As a girl, will I still be routed to NS vocations like NDU and Commandos/Guards?
4.	⁠Why should I not sign on? Do I have a better shot at a career in a private sector after uni?
5.	⁠Is it true that all girls in NS will be on track to SCS or OCS?
6.	⁠How worth it is the SAF scholarship?

Anyone successfully turned weekend book‑outs into something more than a blur?

- Got a go‑to routine that makes the days feel productive and recharging?
- Plan a “day mission” or simple reset ritual to avoid going full zombie mode?
- Even tiny wins - like watching a film start to finish without conking out - count.

However I’m really unwilling to seek help right now, as I really don’t want to Re-BMT. Thus I’m only considering seeking professional help after my POP.

I have a few questions:

1. Is it true that it’s harder to downpes in unit? I’ve heard that it’s harder to get PCC appointments, OC is less willing to help u etc.
2. Once I do submit my memo, will I be posted out or revocated to a support role?
3. Is it possible to post out of my unit even if I’m mono intake?
4. Will I have to rebmt or recourse even if I seek help after POP?

57,Argument with superior. Need advice.,kerthern,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1m71vq7/argument_with_superior_need_advice/,185,0,72,0,2025-07-23T06:27:05Z,Rant,"So today I was arguing with my superior regarding an issue (which I think we were both at fault, and I hope to get some advice on how I can resolve it from here on).

Context: I'm an ASA, and in my office, the NSFs usually sleep during lunch time. I used to sleep at my office seat, but becos there's a ceiling light right above it, I can never sleep well so yesterday, I tried to find a new room to sleep in. I found this room which was supposed to be a lecture room (it just has stacked chairs and tables and nth else), and to my knowledge, it is rarely used, and there are also no signs that say ""no entry"", so I just went in to sleep during lunch. 

Then after I fell asleep, my superior came to that room and started knocking on the door to tell me to get the fuck out of there, and then I woke up and got out. The moment I got out, he scolded me for being in that room.. but there were no senstive materials nor any ""no entry"" signs that say I couldnt enter that room. That is not the worst part. The worst is he accused me of stealing the key to unlock the room, even though it was already unlocked when I entered! 

Apparently last week, the key to that room was stolen (which I didn't even know about.. I only know a key was stolen from my office, but not to that room), so he pushed the blame of the stealing the key on me and said I took it, even tho I didn't even do it.

Now back to the argument today, I admit that I was at fault for supposedly trespassing into that room without legal permission (but at that point I didn't think so as there weren't any no entry signs, which most army rooms wld have if they are not meant to be entered), but my superior doesn't want to admit his mistake and apologise for wrongly accusing me of stealing/taking the key. His explanation? He said that yesterday when he accused me, once I said no I didn't do it, he didn't push on the accusation. Well from my memory, yesterday he kept asking me why the fuck i didnt admit stealing the key, and tbh jus becos u accused someone one time and stop after that doesnt mean it makes u correct right? It's like saying I murdered someone and I realised my mistake so I stop killing people, without admitting nor apologising, and that doesn't make me a murderer.

Sorry for the long rant, but to anyone who was patient and kind enough to read thru this whole passage, are u able to give me any suggestions on how to settle things nicely with my superior? I'm also scared that he may charge me for trespassing so I am hesitant to escalate it to higher ups. Please advice me on what to do, thanks!

Edit: Thank you to everyone who have read through and provided me with your own personal advice on the situation. All of your advice and feedback, regardless of which side you are taking, have helped me comprehend the situation in a much more mature manner. My decision from here on now is to just let it go and let the past be the past. Thank you again for all your advice!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻"

Hi everyone! For context, I’m a uni student (21F), I’m non-Singaporean (living in ASEAN). Since I was an introvert and my sense of humor doesn’t really match with my peers (I’m more comfortable in expressing myself in English), resulting in me not really having much friends irl. Luckily, I found some treasure friends online through videogames and one of them is an NSman, who used to be an Infantryman long ago.

Since then, he was sharing to me a lot of things happening in his NS journey, from his first-ever BMT outfield where he had to practically dig shellscrapes to his funny moments where him and his friends were trolling on their sgt, literally everything. He said he developed best friendships in NS who were his ex-bunkmates where they ate, slept, did everything tgt, and definitely enjoyed the NS chapter of his life. He even showed me a few clips of both his and his friends’ parade, whole time I was just amazed.

I started forming a big passion in learning about NS systems (yet I’m not sg-based so my ns knowledge is very limited), but I do love reading ns stories so much, which is kinda weird coming from a foreigner; however this stems from the fact I don’t really enjoy how lonely uni is and how my life pattern just about same boring routine, slowly I found comfort in reading different experiences of nsf from all postings; from the bottommost stories (tiredness of combat load, unnecessary guard duty/night mission, screwed up meals, weird people etc.), to excitement in ord countdown. I don’t sugarcoat it and I know a lot people think 2-year length is a waste, yet I view it as a meaningful short pause from actual competitive real-life settings that you can only experience once in early 20s. And I admired yall so much for completing such an immense journey.

I don’t have nsf friends and I’m super welcoming to know more about real-time experiences!! I hope I can find some people to discuss/talk (or you can rant) about ns. I’m so down to hear that rather than just watching Ah Boy to Men lol.

Edit: I’m sorry if it seemed like I was trolling, but I do have all proven socials if yall actually want to make friends (DMs open), I just want to hear about the cool stories and stuff yall have since I was interested in ns system which my country doesn’t have it as compulsory. "

Would appreciate it if anyone could share their **honest opinions or experiences**, especially on:

* How is **OCS like** for ME4s? Do I need to go through JCC as well?
* What’s the **ME4 role** like day-to-day, especially in **Maintenance and Engineering, or Ammunition**?
* What are the **real pros and cons** of signing on as ME4?
* Is the **study sponsorship worth it**, or are there downsides I should be aware of?

There’s a certain leadership training institution that constantly preaches pride, discipline, and honour and all those polished slogans you hear at parades and see printed on banners. But behind that shiny image is a system full of hypocrisy, silence, and cowardice.

I’ve witnessed guys joke openly about raping TikTok girls. Loud. Casual. As if it’s normal. And no one stopped them. No one called them out. That’s the kind of culture that’s being protected just because it’s easier to ignore it than to admit your future “leaders” are morally bankrupt.

I once took a simple photo of someone I was interested in and somehow that made me the threat. Someone even threatened to find me over it. And what did the people in charge do? Nothing. Instead, they turned their attention on me.

I got accused of trying to hook up with commanders. Even one who was attached. Completely false, made-up bullshit, thrown around just to ruin my name. Just because I didn’t fit into their clique. Just because I didn’t play the game. They didn’t care about truth. They cared about image, and I was bad PR.

This place claims to “lead with pride,” but all I see is boys playing soldier. Spreading lies. Protecting each other while tearing down anyone who dares to be different. Anyone who dares to speak up.

You don’t lead with pride. You lead with gossip, cowardice, and fear.
You punish the inconvenient. You reward the disgusting.
You tear people like me down and not because we did anything wrong, but because we refuse to stay silent.

My heart doesn’t just burn but it fking bleeds. From betrayal. From watching people I once respected protect filth while stabbing me in the back. From knowing that the uniform means nothing if the people inside it have no soul.

You warned others to avoid me.
But I wasn’t the danger.
I was just a woman who saw the truth and refused to shut up.

So here’s my voice. Loud. Unapologetic.
Fk your fake pride. Fk your hollow leadership.
And fk the cowardice you hide behind the ranks that you never deserve.

A civilian who once respected people who went through the leadership training institute"

Got some questions:

Whats the shortest contract i can sign on? I seen on the website that it is 2 years, but alot of people tell me its 6 years, im confused. I want to sign only 2 years if possible, on the website it says its contract service 2 years.

Will MDES scheme require OCS or SCS?

What is MDES and what do they do? Will it require me to have some engineering degree?? I have a medical related degree if that helps.

While training at home, out of nowhere, I will have a mental breakdown out of nowhere and start crying for no reason. Even when I am consulting my parents, they told me it was alright and it's part of the process and told me not to worry about it. 

I tried to ignore all these negative thoughts but it just kept getting stronger and stronger. I can't even sleep at night with all these negative thoughts. I don't really know what to do. I had a slight depression once during secondary school due to bullying but it was fixed after multiple sessions of counselling and getting it over by myself. But this time, I felt really hopeless and it's been draining me to the point I just feel moody and depressed all the time. 

Just by thinking of the commanders, training and my platoon mates, I will start getting all these negative thoughts. Due to my previous experience with bullying, I am really nervous when interacting with new people and I am afraid of just being a burden to others if I am unable to do something etc. 

I really need help and I would like to ask if there is anything I can do about it. It is affecting me a lot these past few days. Really appreciate if anyone can give me any tips and suggestions. Thanks so much."

I’d probably just give them my protein-rich stuff meats and beans whatnot, would they mind?
