85,Best Way to Share Tapo C402 Camera Access with Immediate Family,bbgarnett,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1lvxjy9/best_way_to_share_tapo_c402_camera_access_with/,0,0,1,0,2025-07-09T23:21:52Z,,"I just ordered two TP-Link **Tapo SolarCam C402 Kits** and they’ll be arriving next week. Will be using them strictly with a Micro SD card and no cloud storage.  We're planning to install them at our family cabin so everyone can keep an eye on the place when we’re not there—mainly to monitor the garden, lake area, and any animals that might be getting into things. I was wondering if there’s any way to set the cameras up so I can give people a **link** to view the feed, **without requiring everyone to download the Tapo app**. Ideally, I’d like it to be **“public” in the sense that it's easily accessible** (like via a URL), but still **private so that only immediate family members can view it**—not just anyone with the link. If that’s not possible, is there at least a way for multiple people to have their own Tapo accounts and log in to view the cameras and or get notifications? Just looking for the simplest way to share access with family without making it a hassle. Thanks!","{'id': 85, 'prediction': 'not viral', 'reason': 'Specific product (Tapo) and use case.

I work at a mall and we recently got a rooftop beehive. My boss wants a continuous live stream of the beehive to stream to a TV on the mall floor. The problem is that we don’t have a computer to run the stream so we need the feed to go from the camera straight to the TV somehow. We can buy a smart TV and weatherproof camera but are at a loss on what to get and how to actually set it up. None of us are very tech savvy, we just want a way to watch our bees! Any help is very appreciated!!! Thank you!","{'id': 86, 'prediction': 'viral', 'reason': 'Unique and interesting topic (beehive at a mall).

Just not sure if there's anything out there like it. 

Basically, is there a system that let's me connect the cameras to a non-internet wifi network (basically a router with no-modem) and transfer footage to an offline central storage hub that way (like an computer or harddrive also on the network)

Would a normal wifi-camera set up allow me to do that?

Sorry if the question doesn't quite make sense. Im just not familiar enough with the industry to know what terminology to even look for. I've been hesitant to look at home secuirty systems because I don't like the idea of someone potentially being able to get into my home Internet wifi, and access the system from the internet (yes, I'm paranoid).

Figure with a non-internet connected wifi, at least someone would have to be phsycially close to try to get in.
