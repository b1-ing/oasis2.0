85,Best Way to Share Tapo C402 Camera Access with Immediate Family,bbgarnett,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1lvxjy9/best_way_to_share_tapo_c402_camera_access_with/,150,0,135,0,2025-07-09T23:21:52Z,,"I just ordered two TP-Link **Tapo SolarCam C402 Kits** and they’ll be arriving next week. Will be using them strictly with a Micro SD card and no cloud storage.  We're planning to install them at our family cabin so everyone can keep an eye on the place when we’re not there—mainly to monitor the garden, lake area, and any animals that might be getting into things. I was wondering if there’s any way to set the cameras up so I can give people a **link** to view the feed, **without requiring everyone to download the Tapo app**. Ideally, I’d like it to be **“public” in the sense that it's easily accessible** (like via a URL), but still **private so that only immediate family members can view it**—not just anyone with the link. If that’s not possible, is there at least a way for multiple people to have their own Tapo accounts and log in to view the cameras and or get notifications? Just looking for the simplest way to share access with family without making it a hassle. Thanks!"

Would a normal wifi-camera set up allow me to do that?

Sorry if the question doesn't quite make sense. Im just not familiar enough with the industry to know what terminology to even look for.

I'm trying to find a basic camera to monitor my barn. I don't need any audio features, absolutely don't want to deal with a subscription, don't really need it to record anything. I just need to be able to look in frequently to check on them without walking out there at all hours, especially when I have girls expecting babies. Night vision would be important but motion detection is not, the animals would set it off every few minutes and that seems silly. It would be technically indoors (the barn is a concrete block building but it does have little screened vents at the top and bottom of two walls) so it won't get wet but it could get cold (just above freezing at the lowest). There is power out there in the form of a regular outlet (I run ac and fans in the summer) so I'd prefer a wired camera. The wifi does just about reach I believe but doing high demand things like video calls in there has had some crunchiness. I imagine that if its just sending video out, no audio, and not receiving anything back it should work? I'd look into cellular but I have a feeling that would be more expensive and I'm on a tighter budget with this. 

I did do some looking of my own at first but all the cheap cameras seem to require subscriptions and have all sorts of extra bells and whistles that really seem like overkill in this situation. I just need to know when one of the girls goes into labor or check in when I'm off the farm just in case. Any help here would be awesome!"

My current blink cameras are notorious for not activating when motion is sensed right away so a lot is missed. I have filed for divorce, just waiting for him to be served, if it was just me I would just leave, but I have 4 kids, one works locally, and school starts in a few weeks, and we have 2 ferrets, and 8 cats whom he has threatened to kill. So please help me find a c camera solution that I can document this for court. "

I’m 18F and I live with my mom, her boyfriend, oldest brother, his gf and 4 of his kids. 
We do live on a budget and just this morning someone broke into both of our storage buildings next to our single-wide trailer and camper, and poured gasoline on my brother’s reptiles while it was me and my nephew home alone.

This is not the first time someone has attempted to break into our storage buildings."
50,UNV NVR having issues with cameras extended via network,LightGuy48,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m26cbn/unv_nvr_having_issues_with_cameras_extended_via/,5,0,5,0,2025-07-17T12:34:13Z,,"I'm working on a UNV NVR system with 100% UNV cameras, no third party hardware. The NVR is a 302-16E-P16-B.  Due to the facility layout having multiple buildings we have four cameras in another building and those four cameras are connected via fiber back to the NVR and plugged into switchport 16 on the rear 16 port PoE switch of the NVR.

However, for some reason the NVR does not seem to 'like' a 2nd switch where multiple cameras are residing on one interface,  I've seen this before at another site too where multiple cameras shared one interface.  Sometimes one or two cameras will disappear and then reappear, sometimes they all disappear. The connection is via two Cisco switches on a GB fiber connection via Cisco SFP's.  Cisco switches show no port errors, no connection drops, nothing abnormal on the line between the buildings.

So is the built in switch on the NVR not a true switch or something unique to the UNV unit where it only wants to see one camera per interface?   Is there a workaround to fix the issue of the cameras disappearing and reappearing?  Thanks!"

40,Installing mesh/AP in between NVR and POE switch that is connected to 4 cameras,jeggernawt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m3cyap/installing_meshap_in_between_nvr_and_poe_switch/,0,0,0,0,2025-07-18T20:23:42Z,,"https://preview.redd.it/2ukma27hxodf1.png?width=1799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6159c951fef7c9b6414661b70555891ce62f8f27

We recently switched ISP providers. Previous provider took back their mesh system. New ISP does have better wifi coverage throughout our home, except in the garage and basement bathroom(wifi reaches about 70% of the time). Now in order to get full wifi coverage in the garage, I was thinking of getting a single unit of a TP link wifi extender/AP/mesh. Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.

Currently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  
Would my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?

Any advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.

edit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.  
NVR in living room to the POE switch in the garage are connected via an ethernet line that runs outside the house. i don't have the skills to run these lines within the walls nor do i have the time. lol. and would/could not spend upwards and maybe over $1000 CAD on getting it done professionally."
