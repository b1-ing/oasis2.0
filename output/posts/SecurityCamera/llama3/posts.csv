85,Best Way to Share Tapo C402 Camera Access with Immediate Family,bbgarnett,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1lvxjy9/best_way_to_share_tapo_c402_camera_access_with/,0,0,0,0,2025-07-09T23:21:52Z,,"I just ordered two TP-Link **Tapo SolarCam C402 Kits** and they’ll be arriving next week. Will be using them strictly with a Micro SD card and no cloud storage.  We're planning to install them at our family cabin so everyone can keep an eye on the place when we’re not there—mainly to monitor the garden, lake area, and any animals that might be getting into things. I was wondering if there’s any way to set the cameras up so I can give people a **link** to view the feed, **without requiring everyone to download the Tapo app**. Ideally, I’d like it to be **“public” in the sense that it's easily accessible** (like via a URL), but still **private so that only immediate family members can view it**—not just anyone with the link. If that’s not possible, is there at least a way for multiple people to have their own Tapo accounts and log in to view the cameras and or get notifications? Just looking for the simplest way to share access with family without making it a hassle. Thanks!","{'id': 85, 'prediction': 'not viral', 'reason': 'Specific product (Tapo) and use case.

We recently switched ISP providers. Previous provider took back their mesh system. New ISP does have better wifi coverage throughout our home, except in the garage and basement bathroom(wifi reaches about 70% of the time). Now in order to get full wifi coverage in the garage, I was thinking of getting a single unit of a TP link wifi extender/AP/mesh. Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.

Currently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  
Would my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?

Any advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.

edit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.  
NVR in living room to the POE switch in the garage are connected via an ethernet line that runs outside the house. i don't have the skills to run these lines within the walls nor do i have the time. lol. and would/could not spend upwards and maybe over $1000 CAD on getting it done professionally.","{'id': 40, 'prediction': 'not viral', 'reason': 'Technical question related to networking and camera setup.

* I already have a bunch of SSD HDs lying around for the NVR.
* The two places I have marked for cameras already have DC power from a previous ADT home security system. AC power would also be easy to provide.

* I would prefer a WiFi compatible NVR and IP cameras so I don't have to run a bunch of Ethernet cable. My wireless network reaches outside just fine and has plenty of bandwidth currently.
* 1080p video quality is fine and 30fps would be nice to have but not necessary. I don't need 4K@60fps or anything like that haha.

I have no particular need to see security footage at this moment, but I have an interest in this because I have come across this situation before. In college, my laptop was stolen from a campus common area in which there was a security camera. When I went to the campus security to see if they could see the security footage for any insight into who stole the laptop, they said they couldn't access the footage and didn't have the expertise to review it even if they did. In my mind, it seems it shouldn't be hard to pull up footage from the date and approximate time an event happened and then examine the footage, but I also want to give people the benefit of the doubt that they aren't being difficult for no reason or lazy.

Any help is appreciated. I’m reasonably tech savvy but I’m not interested in complicated setup and maintaining a server or some central hub. I only need 1 camera. 

Right off the bat I’ll say I’m not paying for a subscription service. 

I want just 1 camera for inside a small apartment, that will give me notifications if it catches movement. If I can get live video of that movement that’s even better. We will only use the camera when away and at night. I don’t want an internet capable (I.e hackable) camera watching me all day, so I also don’t want cloud services if possible. Local storage is preferred. I do understand that getting live footage goes thru an app and they can aquire it that way… if I have to deal with that then I will. But local storage is still preferred because I’m not paying anyone to store footage I don’t care about long term. 

Do they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don’t care about cataloging footage. It’s purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. 

Due to other post recommends. I’m looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I’m having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I’m not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it’s only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. 

Am I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill?

I have no particular need to see security footage at this moment, but I have an interest in this because I have come across this situation before. In college, my laptop was stolen from a campus common area in which there was a security camera. When I went to the campus security to see if they could see the security footage for any insight into who stole the laptop, they said they couldn't access the footage and didn't have the expertise to review it even if they did. In my mind, it seems it shouldn't be hard to pull up footage from the date and approximate time an event happened and then examine the footage, but I also want to give people the benefit of the doubt that they aren't being difficult for no reason or lazy. Is there something more complicated about the process? Is it more about legal liability/not wanting to have to get involved in any sort of court proceedings? Are they renting cameras from the actual police and therefore don't own it or have log in credentials? If anyone knows why this is a phenomenon, let me know! Super curious.

Any help is appreciated. I’m reasonably tech savvy but I’m not interested in complicated setup and maintaining a server or some central hub. I only need 1 camera. 

Right off the bat I’ll say I’m not paying for a subscription service. 

I want just 1 camera for inside a small apartment, that will give me notifications if it catches movement. If I can get live video of that movement that’s even better. We will only use the camera when away and at night. I don’t want an internet capable (I.e hackable) camera watching me all day, so I also don’t want cloud services if possible. Local storage is preferred. I do understand that getting live footage goes thru an app and they can aquire it that way… if I have to deal with that then I will. But local storage is still preferred because I’m not paying anyone to store footage I don’t care about long term. 

Do they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don’t care about cataloging footage. It’s purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. 

Due to other post recommends. I’m looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I’m having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I’m not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it’s only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. 

Am I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill?

I don’t have a cloud subscription or account, and all four cameras record locally to the microSD cards I've installed in each.

I'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand  know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that’s how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. 

If this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that’s how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren’t first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house’s Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers.

14,How exactly is it possible to have remote access to cameras with no cloud account?,BBGonda,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m6xox4/how_exactly_is_it_possible_to_have_remote_access/,0,0,0,0,2025-07-23T02:37:26Z,,"I recently setup some Tapo C120 cameras around the house and over the weekend I was surprised to discover I can access them remotely to live stream, change settings, etc. I was out of the house in another part of the city, nowhere close enough to be connected my house’s wifi, and I was still able to live stream all four cameras from my phone via the app. I had assumed I could only access the cameras while at home connected to my house’s wifi. I don’t have a cloud subscription or account, and all four cameras record locally to the microSD cards I've installed in each.

I'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand  know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that’s how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. 

If this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that’s how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren’t first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house’s Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers. Thank you!","{'id': 14, 'prediction': 'viral', 'reason': 'Addresses a common privacy concern and seeks technical explanation. Many users will also be interested and provide a solution.'}"
