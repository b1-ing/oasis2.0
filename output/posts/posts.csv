46,Camera for catching fly tippers,lonelydaduk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m0oecx/camera_for_catching_fly_tippers/,0,0,0,0,2025-07-15T17:42:02Z,,"I need a camera that’s covert, battery powered and can see number plates at night.

At home I have a unifi system but this location up the road from my house is used by fly tippers weekly. Driving to work and seeing fridges, mattresses and the contents of some unscrupulous house clearing is depressing me so I need to take some vigilante action and capture them.

I’ve done some base research but I think most night cameras reflect number plates (i know my unifi cameras do) so looking for recommendations.

I have an issue with a person surveilling my house. She never enters the property but does drive by and stop on the street to ""look"". Lawyers advised to see if I can record her and we can show a pattern of obsession. (Not looking far advise on how to deal with her)
Anyhow, I do have a home security system (eufy) but the house is further back from the street and the cams wouldn't capture anything. I also live on a street with frequent traffic. 
So what I'm looking for is a solution that only records the stalkers car, even at night, and doesn't need wifi as the signal might not always reach to the street. I'm also not a super technical person, easy out of the box setup would be great!"

44,"tight budget, camera system that uses google one storage",nexgenasian,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m13v0w/tight_budget_camera_system_that_uses_google_one/,0,0,0,0,2025-07-16T04:58:08Z,,Is there a security camera that lets you set up google one as the storage? I'd like to store data to the cloud whenever there's motion or sound and get alerts. I'm on a budget of about $100 a camera and would like to only pay for the google one subscription. Preferably it would also only use so much of the google one drive and delete older files say after 10 GBs.  Thanks for the help in advance!
45,DW Spectrum cloud issues,hamel2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m10qwq/dw_spectrum_cloud_issues/,0,0,0,0,2025-07-16T02:14:12Z,,Is anyone using DW Spectrum and having issues with the cloud accounts getting timed out weekly?  I have multiple sites that have clients logged in with a cloud account for remote view of their systems and in the past few months I have been having them get timed out every week even though on those servers the settings are set to not limit session duration.  When this happens my phone and laptop will have issues getting back into the cloud account as well.  I have raised multiple support tickets and have gotten nowhere with support.  The last one was to update to the latest version which has been done on all the sites but then again tonight it timed out again.  It also seems to be hit and miss on whether I can just sign them right back in or I have to wait for an hour or so like tonight.  The only thing i have noticed is that systems that are on V5 still do not appear to have this issue.  Just V6..
