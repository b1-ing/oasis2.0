94,Best Budget Battery Security Cams for Prime Day? (No Wiring Needed),No-Structure828,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1lv1x30/best_budget_battery_security_cams_for_prime_day/,0,0,7,0,2025-07-08T22:09:59Z,,"Hey all,

  
Just moved into a new place and I‚Äôm looking for 2‚Äì3 budget-friendly, battery-powered security cameras ideally from a decent brand. I really don‚Äôt want to mess with wiring, so wireless/battery is a must for me. My main goal is to cover the cars and the back door, which faces a busy estate walkway (looooots of kids and dog walkers).

Since it‚Äôs Prime Day, I‚Äôd like to snag a deal if possible. I‚Äôm currently eyeing the TP-Link Tapo TC82 and TC85 (2K battery cams), they seem decent for the price. I used Reolink before (wired, though), and was thinking maybe add the TD21 Tapo video doorbell as well. Also noticed some Eufy cams on sale.

Can anyone recommend solid battery-powered options for Prime Day deals? Bonus if you‚Äôve used any of these and can share your experience. Thanks!"

So I have swann poe, 8 channel 6 camera working, had long cables so decided to shorten them, (did this before and no issues) I have an outdoor 60 foot cable that worked fine but after the shorten I get no image but power.

I checked my cable with tester and 100% working. 

I tried bran new camera on 60 foot cable and nothing.

I tried different ports and nothing.

Tried different power slot on power square  and nothing. 

I tried a 10 foot cable on the new camera and works.

Shows it's getting power in the software.

Rebooted, waiting 10 minutes and nothing. 

Anyone have any ideas what this issue could be?? 

Thanks.

Night vision would be important but motion detection is not, the animals would set it off every few minutes and that seems silly. It would be technically indoors (the barn is a concrete block building but it does have little screened vents at the top and bottom of two walls) so it won't get wet but it could get cold (just above freezing at the lowest). There is power out there in the form of a regular outlet (I run ac and fans in the summer) so I'd prefer a wired camera. The wifi does just about reach I believe but doing high demand things like video calls in there has had some crunchiness. I imagine that if its just sending video out, no audio, and not receiving anything back it should work? I'd look into cellular but I have a feeling that would be more expensive and I'm on a tighter budget with this.

The NVR is a 302-16E-P16-B.  Due to the facility layout having multiple buildings we have four cameras in another building and those four cameras are connected via fiber back to the NVR and plugged into switchport 16 on the rear 16 port PoE switch of the NVR.

However, for some reason the NVR does not seem to 'like' a 2nd switch where multiple cameras are residing on one interface,  I've seen this before at another site too where multiple cameras shared one interface.  Sometimes one or two cameras will disappear and then reappear, sometimes they all disappear. The connection is via two Cisco switches on a GB fiber connection via Cisco SFP's.  Cisco switches show no port errors, no connection drops, nothing abnormal on the line between the buildings.

So is the built in switch on the NVR not a true switch or something unique to the UNV unit where it only wants to see one camera per interface?   Is there a workaround to fix the issue of the cameras disappearing and reappearing?  Thanks!"

We recently switched ISP providers. Previous provider took back their mesh system. New ISP does have better wifi coverage throughout our home, except in the garage and basement bathroom(wifi reaches about 70% of the time). Now in order to get full wifi coverage in the garage, I was thinking of getting a single unit of a TP link wifi extender/AP/mesh. Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.

Currently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  
Would my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?

Any advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.

edit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.  
NVR in living room to the POE switch in the garage are connected via an ethernet line that runs outside the house. i don't have the skills to run these lines within the walls nor do i have the time. lol. and would/could not spend upwards and maybe over $1000 CAD on getting it done professionally."

* I already have a bunch of SSD HDs lying around for the NVR.
* The two places I have marked for cameras already have DC power from a previous ADT home security system. AC power would also be easy to provide.
* Since the NVR would be local to my network my goal would be avoid apps and subscriptions and I would simply view the videos locally as needed.
* I would prefer a WiFi compatible NVR and IP cameras so I don't have to run a bunch of Ethernet cable. My wireless network reaches outside just fine and has plenty of bandwidth currently.
* 1080p video quality is fine and 30fps would be nice to have but not necessary. I don't need 4K@60fps or anything like that haha.

I have no particular need to see security footage at this moment, but I have an interest in this because I have come across this situation before. In college, my laptop was stolen from a campus common area in which there was a security camera. When I went to the campus security to see if they could see the security footage for any insight into who stole the laptop, they said they couldn't access the footage and didn't have the expertise to review it even if they did. In my mind, it seems it shouldn't be hard to pull up footage from the date and approximate time an event happened and then examine the footage, but I also want to give people the benefit of the doubt that they aren't being difficult for no reason or lazy. Is there something more complicated about the process? Is it more about legal liability/not wanting to have to get involved in any sort of court proceedings? Are they renting cameras from the actual police and therefore don't own it or have log in credentials? If anyone knows why this is a phenomenon, let me know! Super curious.

Do they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don‚Äôt care about cataloging footage. It‚Äôs purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. 

Due to other post recommends. I‚Äôm looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I‚Äôm having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I‚Äôm not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it‚Äôs only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. 

Am I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill?

I apologise this isnt a strictly Security camera question.

At my place of business I have a coil lifter very similar to this but it has been reengineered and in the reengineering the operator's vision is now somewhat obstructed, is the short range camera or technology (I thought maybe RF or something that could do the trick?)

I don‚Äôt have a cloud subscription or account, and all four cameras record locally to the microSD cards I've installed in each.

I'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand ¬†know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that‚Äôs how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. 

If this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that‚Äôs how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren‚Äôt first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house‚Äôs Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers. Thank you!"
