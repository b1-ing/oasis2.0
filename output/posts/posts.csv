46,Camera for catching fly tippers,lonelydaduk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCamera/comments/1m0oecx/camera_for_catching_fly_tippers/,0,0,0,0,2025-07-15T17:42:02Z,,"I need a camera that’s covert, battery powered and can see number plates at night.

At home I have a unifi system but this location up the road from my house is used by fly tippers weekly. Driving to work and seeing fridges, mattresses and the contents of some unscrupulous house clearing is depressing me so I need to take some vigilante action and capture them.

I’ve done some base research but I think most night cameras reflect number plates (i know my unifi cameras do) so looking for recommendations.

I have an issue with a person surveilling my house. She never enters the property but does drive by and stop on the street to ""look"". Lawyers advised to see if I can record her and we can show a pattern of obsession. (Not looking far advise on how to deal with her)
Anyhow, I do have a home security system (eufy) but the house is further back from the street and the cams wouldn't capture anything. I also live on a street with frequent traffic. 
So what I'm looking for is a solution that only records the stalkers car, even at night, and doesn't need wifi as the signal might not always reach to the street. I'm also not a super technical person, easy out of the box setup would be great!"
