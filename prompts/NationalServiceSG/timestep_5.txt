You are acting as a decision making body of 322.5 agents browsing the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit.

Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.

1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. They can ignore posts.

2. Agents' behavior:
- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic
- You may ask clarifying questions
- Donâ€™t overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0

My unit scheduled me for ippt on 26th july and when i asked why i was booked so early they said they want to promote me to be a TL (team leader) during my reservist deployments. Problem is I have come down with a fever and am unable to take the ippt. Is it possible to take teleconsult MC from seedr or manadr or do i have to go to a polyclinic. To be fair I also don't really want to take on the role of a TL... but my unit is low on manpower..."

So far, most of the opinions I\u2019ve heard has been quite positive \u2014 but I\u2019m still a bit skeptical and want to make sure I go into this with eyes open.\n\nWould appreciate it if anyone could share their **honest opinions or experiences**, especially on:\n\n* How is **OCS like** for ME4s? Do I need to go through JCC as well?\n* What\u2019s the **ME4 role** like day-to-day, especially in **Maintenance and Engineering, or Ammunition**?\n* What are the **real pros and cons** of signing on as ME4?\n* Is the **study sponsorship worth it**, or are there downsides I should be aware of?\n\nJust trying to make a well-informed decision before committing. Appreciate any insights \u2013 good or bad. Thanks in advance!"

And I\u2019m done staying silent.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain leadership training institution that constantly preaches pride, discipline, and honour and all those polished slogans you hear at parades and see printed on banners. But behind that shiny image is a system full of hypocrisy, silence, and cowardice.\n\nI\u2019ve witnessed guys joke openly about raping TikTok girls. Loud. Casual. As if it\u2019s normal. And no one stopped them. No one called them out. That\u2019s the kind of culture that\u2019s being protected just because it\u2019s easier to ignore it than to admit your future \u201cleaders\u201d are morally bankrupt.\n\nI once took a simple photo of someone I was interested in and somehow that made me the threat. Someone even threatened to find me over it. And what did the people in charge do? Nothing. Instead, they turned their attention on me.\n\nI got accused of trying to hook up with commanders. Even one who was attached. Completely false, made-up bullshit, thrown around just to ruin my name. Just because I didn\u2019t fit into their clique. Just because I didn\u2019t play the game. They didn\u2019t care about truth. They cared about image, and I was bad PR.\n\nThis place claims to \u201clead with pride,\u201d but all I see is boys playing soldier. Spreading lies. Protecting each other while tearing down anyone who dares to be different. Anyone who dares to speak up.\n\nYou don\u2019t lead with pride. You lead with gossip, cowardice, and fear.\nYou punish the inconvenient. You reward the disgusting.\nYou tear people like me down and not because we did anything wrong, but because we refuse to stay silent.\n\nMy heart doesn\u2019t just burn but it fking bleeds. From betrayal. From watching people I once respected protect filth while stabbing me in the back. From knowing that the uniform means nothing if the people inside it have no soul.\n\nYou warned others to avoid me.\nBut I wasn\u2019t the danger.\nI was just a woman who saw the truth and refused to shut up.\n\nSo here\u2019s my voice. Loud. Unapologetic.\nFk your fake pride. Fk your hollow leadership.\nAnd fk the cowardice you hide behind the ranks that you never deserve.\n\nFrom,\nA civilian who once respected people who went through the leadership training institute"
