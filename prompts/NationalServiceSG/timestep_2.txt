You are acting as a decision making body of 322.5 agents browsing the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit.

Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.

1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. They can ignore posts.

2. Agents' behavior:
- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic
- You may ask clarifying questions
- Donâ€™t overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0

For context, I am set to complete my International Baccalaureate Diploma in November 2026 so I have been thinking about what I\u2019d like to pursue thereafter. I have been volunteering for National Day and though I\u2019m aware that its a display of the more glamorous aspect of our nation\u2019s defence, it has piqued my curiosity regarding a career in the army/airforce. If I choose to not sign on, I will likely pursue a PLE degree or law at the tertiary level. I have no brothers and my father attended NS awhile ago, so it would be great if I could get some answers to my questions \ud83d\ude0a\n\n1.\t\u2060If I were to sign on, should I apply for university first, then sign on via the Mindef website, if no, what is the proper pathway I should take while approaching this?\n2.\t\u2060In the 2 years of NS, what will I experience other than BMT?\n3.\t\u2060As a girl, will I still be routed to NS vocations like NDU and Commandos/Guards?\n4.\t\u2060Why should I not sign on? Do I have a better shot at a career in a private sector after uni?\n5.\t\u2060Is it true that all girls in NS will be on track to SCS or OCS?\n6.\t\u2060How worth it is the SAF scholarship?\n\n\nIf there is anything you think I should know or take as a precaution before signing on please let me know! It would be greatly appreciated as I\u2019m still abit clueless \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude13"

Since the MUP never auto calculated.\nIs that correct??\n\n(Forgot to mentioned that I'm from SCDF/MHA)"
