Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.

1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. They can ignore posts.

2. Agents' behavior:
- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic
- You may ask clarifying questions
- Donâ€™t overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0

From experience, this is a genuine worry I should have? Or is it just paranoid?"

Since I\u2019m still technically PES B1 and not officially downpassed yet, I\u2019m really scared I might end up getting posted before proper psychiatric evaluation happens."

Matter of fact, I'm looking for the slackest most chaokeng job a commando can get, ironic I know. \n\nI live in the west, so stagmont camp (signals) is at the top of my list, appreciate if anyone could share their experience.

(Waiting for medical board to review)\n\nAlso, would like some intake on what\u2019s the attire like to book in/out if I was to be placed in the holding area/room after POP while waiting for my down pes to be fully processed and given a support vocation? Is it smart 4 or? And do we get to wear admin attire when in camp after that like when walking around/going for lunch and etc\n\nWould appreciate if anyone here knows! \ud83e\udd72"

So how do yall just listen and not do anything without feeling useless :/ btw im a Cpl and he\u2019s not my buddy spec he just looks out for me on his own accord so technically its not really his job ? Cause there\u2019s a spec to operator ratio and its 1:1 in my plt cause of how small it is"
