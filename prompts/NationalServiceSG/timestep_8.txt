You are acting as a decision making body of 322.5 agents browsing the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit.

Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.

1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. They can ignore posts.

2. Agents' behavior:
- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic
- You may ask clarifying questions
- Donâ€™t overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0

At most, ive been a group leader for school projects which shld be similar to leading a team of 6 ppl as a me1 rite? thus i dont feel it's right to take on a leadership role when Im most likely going to be poor at it (i prob wouldn't make it past the assesment in the first place)."

However, I don\u2019t entirely hate the concept of NS and will just get it over and done with. But I\u2019ve got several questions:\n\n1) Is it possible to skip meals or give my buddies some extra food from my plate? I\u2019d eat the bare minimum so I don\u2019t get any large bone or muscle growth that would make me look like a man when older but enough to survive. I\u2019d probably just give them my protein-rich stuff meats and beans whatnot, would they mind?\n\n2) What\u2019s to say, hypothetically, for the funny, I get hormones and medication from Indonesia and Thailand (if your curious you convert money into crypto and give them, it\u2019s a very weird system but as long as I get my meds) and just go on them DIY. Then after a year I go MO and show them. What\u2019s gonna happen? "

Even now, I still haven't adjusted. I've broken down and cried 5 times (Yes, I counted) when training gets too tough, timing is so rushed, or the use of weapons. There was the problem my personality and freedom stripped away from me, forcing me to become someone I never wanted to become; a soldier.\n\nAccording to my section mates, outfield will start early August. Living in the jungle for days without clean water, dirt all over you and the worst of all of me...away from my family. I've always contacted them every night before light's out, and outfield won't give me that privilege.\n\nCould anyone share with me what will I be going through at Outfield? At the very least, I could prepare myself mentally. I've received help from MO, OO and even the councillor from CareHub, so I'm should be hanging on...for now."
