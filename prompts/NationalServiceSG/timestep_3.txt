You are acting as a decision making body of 322.5 agents browsing the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit.

Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.

1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. They can ignore posts.

2. Agents' behavior:
- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic
- You may ask clarifying questions
- Donâ€™t overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0

Are there prayer rooms at BMTC or will I have to pray in bunk? Also is there any possibility to pray during outfield? Any muslims can share their experience or if anyone have had practicing muslims in the same bunk as you? Thank you. "

Did they use my NAPFA results from secondary school as a basis but it cant be that because my results were decent, not enough to warrant an E1. Is my eye surgery that drastic that I get an E1? What do i need to prove and submit to up PES because i have no interest in doing menial shit for NS. "

The thought of army life is the definitely the main attributing factor to my recent bouts of panic attacks. My mental health prior to this has never been that good too honestly caused by other factors not relating to NS (toxic/abusive relationships and other personal issues). Just want to ask whether anyone got any advice or experience for situations like these. Thanks"
