You are acting as a decision making body of 322.5 agents browsing the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit.

Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.

1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. They can ignore posts.

2. Agents' behavior:
- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic
- You may ask clarifying questions
- Donâ€™t overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0

I recently had a really messy breakup and my parents filed for divorce a month after. I have been caught in the legal battle between them and I feel abandoned by my parents in the midst of this as well.\nI have a counselling session scheduled with scc and a referral for PCC, but I dont know how long they will take to process my case and help in any way.\n\nSince I am PES A, they posted me to a combat voc and I genuinely dont think I can cope with all that is on my plate. I have been really anxious even waking up in the middle of the night, nightmares or even trouble sleeping as well. I have been given an excuse stay in for 30 days along with excuse weapons for 84 days by the MO but this environment is only deteriorating my mental health further. Its getting more urgent and im not sure what I can or should do. I really need help. Anyone with advice on this would be greatly appreciated :\")"

Its quite confusing cuz these me4s have not been through ocs unlike their younger me4 counterparts. Also has anyone seen arrowncrab rank enciks rise to 1 bar above before? just curious abt it\n\nJust another side qn, if signing on military expert stuff gives u more room for career progression, why do some people still choose the conventional system over it?"

It has been a really tough 2 years, going through all the grueling training, some bad commanders, some over demanding enciks, toxic environment at times and lousy cookhouse food. Seeing him endure and mature and able to discern good and bad characters is heartening. \n\nIt is time now for him to put NS behind him and embark on his next journey. \n\nCongrats to those who ORD this month too. To those who are going to enlist or going through the tough times, take good care of yourself and know that it will pass. Your family is proud of you too!"

While training at home, out of nowhere, I will have a mental breakdown out of nowhere and start crying for no reason. Even when I am consulting my parents, they told me it was alright and it's part of the process and told me not to worry about it. \n\nI tried to ignore all these negative thoughts but it just kept getting stronger and stronger. I can't even sleep at night with all these negative thoughts. I don't really know what to do. I had a slight depression once during secondary school due to bullying but it was fixed after multiple sessions of counselling and getting it over by myself. But this time, I felt really hopeless and it's been draining me to the point I just feel moody and depressed all the time. \n\nJust by thinking of the commanders, training and my platoon mates, I will start getting all these negative thoughts. Due to my previous experience with bullying, I am really nervous when interacting with new people and I am afraid of just being a burden to others if I am unable to do something etc. \n\nI really need help and I would like to ask if there is anything I can do about it. It is affecting me a lot these past few days. Really appreciate if anyone can give me any tips and suggestions. Thanks so much."
