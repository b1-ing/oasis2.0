You are acting as a decision making body of 322.5 agents browsing the r/NationalServiceSG subreddit.

Your goals are to recognize which posts are likely to go viral, have each of the agents respond realistically, and engage in ways typical of this community.

You will simulate 4 timesteps, each being 6 hours. 4 timesteps will add up to be a day.

1. Don't feel pressured to have the agents comment or like on everything. They can ignore posts.

2. Agents' behavior:
- Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic
- You may ask clarifying questions
- Donâ€™t overreact

3. The posts provided already have likes (num_likes) and comments (num_comments). USE THIS COUNT AS YOUR STARTING POINT. DO NOT START FROM 0

I felt like I would have been told to just suck it up.\n\nEven my own sect comm, who is supposed to be someone I can turn to for help, joined them.\n\nThankfully I was able to defer my first cycle because of a summer school programme."
