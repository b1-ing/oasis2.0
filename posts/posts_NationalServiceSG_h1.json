I feel like I’m just dragging my body through each day while my mind is shutting down.\n\nI’m not even staying in Singapore, so I don’t have the time or place to properly see an outside doctor or get a memo. On top of that, I feel like I have no life anymore — I only get a few hours of real rest a week, and it’s not enough to recover mentally or physically. Recently, I’ve even been having dark thoughts about whether life is worth going on like this.\n\nI’ve seen the MO, got referred to pcc (still waiting for the appointment date), but honestly I’m scared they’ll just throw me a downgrade and expect me to push through instead of letting me go. I’m not trying to siam NS — I understand everyone has to serve, but I genuinely don’t think I can last two years like this without completely breaking. I just want to get better, and right now I don’t see how that can happen while stuck here.\n\nHas anyone here actually managed to get PES F for mental health reasons?

I'm a PES B1 and actually am quite excited yet anxious to go to NS... anxious because I don't want to have a bad time being pressured by mean sergeants or not being able to make friends...\n\nCutting straight to the chase: I don't really want to become infantry guard artillery etc. boring vocations with endless training, despite knowing choice being a mere illusion in the military. I have been working hard as a biochem student and have knowledge regarding wound treating, pharmaceuticals, and human anatomy (also quite a bit of disease diagnosing and dissection using animal models), and I often collaborate well within a team as a leader (with rather positive morale). Thus I was wondering if there is still a chance for me to become a medic or sergeant as a PR... (or military police? I wanna seek some purpose during NS as well)\n\nHas there been cases of Chinese PR been able to join the SCS (even better OCS but I wouldn't even dream of it) or been allocated to special vocations such as medics in SAF? Or is it extremely rare for a PR to get these vocations no matter how hard they try due to preference towards citizens?\n\nI'm quite ignorant regarding NS facts so any piece of opinion or advice will be greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: Thx yall! I've stopped dreading about whatever vocation I might get posted to and decided to embrace it and make the best of it ;)"

Or maybe the person just forgot to pass my number?? What are some reasons i might have been blacklisted?? I have no bad records from my nsf days, got good conduct everything. Only thing was i used to be non combat fit, and i called ARC before during my nsf days and thry told me to up pes before signing on, and recently i up pes, but they still seem to have rejected me. Not an official rejection but they seem to not want me. \n\n\nOr maybe im just being too worried, maybe the guy forgot to give my number to the recruiter idk. What do you guys think?"

People just glance past you like you’re any other commuter.\n\nNot saying we expect special treatment - but sometimes, especially after a long week in camp, a small gesture like someone offering a seat or even saying “thanks for serving” would honestly mean a lot.\n\nCurious if others feel the same. Have you ever experienced unexpected courtesy while in uniform - or do you just keep your head down and move on?"

My general diet doesn’t include much of red meat or high iron diet.\n\nThe MO told me to go to a Polyclinic to get some iron supplements and would have to down pes me due to my low blood count.\n\nHonestly, I want to complete my BMT in tekong and not get down pes.\n\nHope that somebody have some idea on how to discuss this with MO."

I am also on my final year in local Uni taking part time degree in Business.\n\nI was keen to explore more on cyber defence and security thus applying for the role. I have my MAPAS test and interview scheduled next week. However, upon speaking with the recruiter, he mentioned that I should apply for MIE instead due to my lack of experience.\n\nI looked at the role and realised that the trainee and actual pay was very low, and progression doesnt seem that good especially going in as ME1. Should I still attempt to go for the interview for C4X or should I just cancel the interview to not waste my time and their time? I am aware of the pros and cons of signing on and I am ok with them apart from the low pay."

    "post_text": "\n\nContext: I'm currently pes b1 doing bmt, I have diagnosed gout and am xurrently on medication for it however sometimes due to circumstances, be it a tight schedule or some other issues I do not take the medication resulting in a gout flare which pretty much cripples me for a few days till I can walk properly again, secondly I also have a kidney issues where one side is slightly smaller than the other causing it to overwork and leak protein into my urine which would result in that kidney \"dying\" quicker than an average one, therefore I started telmisartan for that issue, however that medication has started causing me headaches and lightheadedness that I did not feel before taking that medication. Lastly I had an old Achilles injury from basketball on my right leg that I did not declare before entering as I wanted to try and go throught the whole bmt experience, however after doing outfield, my Achilles injury started acting up quite a bit after being in boots for so long which made me limp from place to place. Can I get some advice as on what to do and if I even have a chance to down pes? As I've gone for medical review and the doctors seem ABIT hesitant as to whether or not I can. As much as Ive been enjoying my experience in bmt so far I'm not to sure how far my body can go until it breaks down, to add on I'm part of mono guards which means I'll be doing gvt or GCC depending on my posting and truthfully I'm not planning to sign on so I do not want to risk my health just for two years of ns. Please help thank you 🙂"

(I'm aware it's not all sunshine and rainbows though) I'm ok with a bit shiong stuff, just not shiong like guards or infantry. I don't think I'll be very interested if I have to go outfield very frequently too.

You won't do IPPT but you'll still do Foot drills and prepare for POP Parade and Rescue Training. As for punishment s you'll write lines that's about it. Some days will be chill and some days will be shag but you gotta remember to count yourself lucky that you're not in Tekong training.\n\nTry to not isolate yourself and dread over the month ah cause trust me you won't enjoy BRT if you do that instead socialise and get to know your bunkmates, your platoonmates and your Sgts, Enciks and Sirs ah. BRT was fun for me and I made alot of memories with them.\n\nLastly, since BRT is only gonna be a month, try not to MC or RSO cause really it's only a month and the time passes really fast and you'll miss out ah. Also please please don't give your Sergeants, Enciks and Sirs any trouble cause they will kenna and not us, try not to make their lives difficult since your BRT gonna be slack."

I'm PES B1 and my Singaporean friend told me that it is almost certain that I will be joining an active combat position after my BMT, which will heavily restrict my freedom.

After a short consultation with the doctor, they said that my symptoms point towards a panic attack disorder. They gave me a referral to a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis but the earliest date they could book for me coincides with the day that I'll be in Tekong (confinement period, which is late this month).\n\nWill I even be able to show up? I don't think I can change the date that easily because this kind of thing is scheduled months ahead. The doctor suggested that if I really want a diagnosis ASAP and declare before I enlist, I'll have to go private. I'm thinking of following that advice but I don't know if it's any better. AFAIK the only downside to it is that my enlist date will be pushed back right? I don't really mind.\n\nI heard if people declare during confinement they'll have to be excused from showing up or sit out some activities, all that stuff. It sounds troublesome—makes me think I should just follow the doctor's advice so that I won't have to worry about any complications while I serve. Because if they delay my enlist date, everything will be sorted out by then right? Again, I don't know what's best so I'm really hoping to get some answers/opinions\n\nTL;DR Facing mental health issues, not sure whether to get + declare my diagnosis after I enlist to avoid complicating things while in camp"

This is not about him specifically, it is a reflection into the system.\n\n**I am a farmer.**  I grew up believing that hard work will get you somewhere, And of course, you must play your cards right. Like many of you, I did not have a father who was somebody. \\[In fact if you didn't know your father, that does make your father as a nobody\\]. I believe in meritocracy. Unfortunately, with how small Singapore is, and how everyone is related to one another, it can be hard to hold this value. You do feel a big sense of nepotism looming in the country. Whether that is true or not, I cannot comment on that. I am a farmer. \n\n [There is a comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/comment/n36tpzd/)in the tread that asks if the son made it to command school. That specific comment was answered with saying that the son did not make it into command school. Further replies speculated that the son did not pass IPPT as the definite reason. \n\nWhether was it because of the incident, or because of IPPT, I am happy. I am happy not because of the former chief of army's son did not make it to a command school, but because the system is working as it should be. \n\nA couple of years ago, Winston Choo, who was the first CDF, attended his grandson's officer commissioning ceremony.  [This was reported by mothership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02B1AYrV8w). There were a few comments that hinted at nepotism and it was \"given to him\". As quoted from one:\n\n&gt;Everyone knew he'd be an officer way before he even entered NS. Imagine the chief of defence's grandson not being a decorated soldier. His commanders were all probably too scared of doing anything to him.\n\nIt is easy to draw lines. And maybe more so that CDF is higher ranking then CoA. But CoA isn't some small time position either. So I show happiness, not because of the underachievement of someone, but because it is testament to my belief. The belief of meritocracy.\n\nOn the sideline I also wonder: what kind of pressure do the descendants of these high flyers face to perform, being involuntarily linked to that legacy. \n\nOh, and &gt;!because I said I am a farmer,  I[ do enjoy farming videos. ](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSSUEmdGL/)As the saying goes:  老师有穿衣服，我差一点认不出老师了！！!&lt;"

At most, ive been a group leader for school projects which shld be similar to leading a team of 6 ppl as a me1 rite? thus i dont feel it's right to take on a leadership role when Im most likely going to be poor at it (i prob wouldn't make it past the assesment in the first place)."

I\u2019d eat the bare minimum so I don\u2019t get any large bone or muscle growth that would make me look like a man when older but enough to survive. I\u2019d probably just give them my protein-rich stuff meats and beans whatnot, would they mind?\n\n2) What\u2019s to say, hypothetically, for the funny, I get hormones and medication from Indonesia and Thailand (if your curious you convert money into crypto and give them, it\u2019s a very weird system but as long as I get my meds) and just go on them DIY. Then after a year I go MO and show them. What\u2019s gonna happen? "

I've always contacted them every night before light's out, and outfield won't give me that privilege.\n\nCould anyone share with me what will I be going through at Outfield?

Even when I am consulting my parents, they told me it was alright and it's part of the process and told me not to worry about it. \n\nI tried to ignore all these negative thoughts but it just kept getting stronger and stronger. I can't even sleep at night with all these negative thoughts. I don't really know what to do. I had a slight depression once during secondary school due to bullying but it was fixed after multiple sessions of counselling and getting it over by myself. But this time, I felt really hopeless and it's been draining me to the point I just feel moody and depressed all the time. \n\nJust by thinking of the commanders, training and my platoon mates, I will start getting all these negative thoughts. Due to my previous experience with bullying, I am really nervous when interacting with new people and I am afraid of just being a burden to others if I am unable to do something etc. \n\nI really need help and I would like to ask if there is anything I can do about it. It is affecting me a lot these past few days. Really appreciate if anyone can give me any tips and suggestions. Thanks so much."

And no one stopped them. No one called them out. That\u2019s the kind of culture that\u2019s being protected just because it\u2019s easier to ignore it than to admit your future \u201cleaders\u201d are morally bankrupt.\n\nI once took a simple photo of someone I was interested in and somehow that made me the threat. Someone even threatened to find me over it. And what did the people in charge do? Nothing. Instead, they turned their attention on me.\n\nI got accused of trying to hook up with commanders. Even one who was attached. Completely false, made-up bullshit, thrown around just to ruin my name. Just because I didn\u2019t fit into their clique. Just because I didn\u2019t play the game. They didn\u2019t care about truth. They cared about image, and I was bad PR.\n\nThis place claims to \u201clead with pride,\u201d but all I see is boys playing soldier. Spreading lies.

From knowing that the uniform means nothing if the people inside it have no soul.\n\nYou warned others to avoid me.\nBut I wasn\u2019t the danger.\nI was just a woman who saw the truth and refused to shut up.\n\nSo here\u2019s my voice.

      "post_text": "So today I was arguing with my superior regarding an issue (which I think we were both at fault, and I hope to get some advice on how I can resolve it from here on).\n\nContext: I'm an ASA, and in my office, the NSFs usually sleep during lunch time. I used to sleep at my office seat, but becos there's a ceiling light right above it, I can never sleep well so yesterday, I tried to find a new room to sleep in. I found this room which was supposed to be a lecture room (it just has stacked chairs and tables and nth else), and to my knowledge, it is rarely used, and there are also no signs that say \"no entry\", so I just went in to sleep during lunch. \n\nThen after I fell asleep, my superior came to that room and started knocking on the door to tell me to get the fuck out of there, and then I woke up and got out. The moment I got out, he scolded me for being in that room.. but there were no senstive materials nor any \"no entry\" signs that say I couldnt enter that room. That is not the worst part. The worst is he accused me of stealing the key to unlock the room, even though it was already unlocked when I entered! \n\nApparently last week, the key to that room was stolen (which I didn't even know about.. I only know a key was stolen from my office, but not to that room), so he pushed the blame of the stealing the key on me and said I took it, even tho I didn't even do it.\n\nNow back to the argument today, I admit that I was at fault for supposedly trespassing into that room without legal permission (but at that point I didn't think so as there weren't any no entry signs, which most army rooms wld have if they are not meant to be entered), but my superior doesn't want to admit his mistake and apologise for wrongly accusing me of stealing/taking the key. His explanation? He said that yesterday when he accused me, once I said no I didn't do it, he didn't push on the accusation. Well from my memory, yesterday he kept asking me why the fuck i didnt admit stealing the key, and tbh jus becos u accused someone one time and stop after that doesnt mean it makes u correct right? It's like saying I murdered someone and I realised my mistake so I stop killing people, without admitting nor apologising, and that doesn't make me a murderer.\n\nSorry for the long rant, but to anyone who was patient and kind enough to read thru this whole passage, are u able to give me any suggestions on how to settle things nicely with my superior? I'm also scared that he may charge me for trespassing so I am hesitant to escalate it to higher ups. Please advice me on what to do, thanks!\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who have read through and provided me with your own personal advice on the situation. All of your advice and feedback, regardless of which side you are taking, have helped me comprehend the situation in a much more mature manner. My decision from here on now is to just let it go and let the past be the past. Thank you again for all your advice!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb"

For context, I\u2019m a uni student (21F), I\u2019m non-Singaporean (living in ASEAN). Since I was an introvert and my sense of humor doesn\u2019t really match with my peers (I\u2019m more comfortable in expressing myself in English), resulting in me not really having much friends irl. Luckily, I found some treasure friends online through videogames and one of them is an NSman, who used to be an Infantryman long ago.\n\nSince then, he was sharing to me a lot of things happening in his NS journey, from his first-ever BMT outfield where he had to practically dig shellscrapes to his funny moments where him and his friends were trolling on their sgt, literally everything. He said he developed best friendships in NS who were his ex-bunkmates where they ate, slept, did everything tgt, and definitely enjoyed the NS chapter of his life. He even showed me a few clips of both his and his friends\u2019 parade, whole time I was just amazed.\n\nI started forming a big passion in learning about NS systems (yet I\u2019m not sg-based so my ns knowledge is very limited), but I do love reading ns stories so much, which is kinda weird coming from a foreigner; however this stems from the fact I don\u2019t really enjoy how lonely uni is and how my life pattern just about same boring routine, slowly I found comfort in reading different experiences of nsf from all postings; from the bottommost stories (tiredness of combat load, unnecessary guard duty/night mission, screwed up meals, weird people etc.), to excitement in ord countdown. I don\u2019t sugarcoat it and I know a lot people think 2-year length is a waste, yet I view it as a meaningful short pause from actual competitive real-life settings that you can only experience once in early 20s. And I admired yall so much for completing such an immense journey.\n\nI don\u2019t have nsf friends and I\u2019m super welcoming to know more about real-time experiences!! I hope I can find some people to discuss/talk (or you can rant) about ns. I\u2019m so down to hear that rather than just watching Ah Boy to Men lol.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry if it seemed like I was trolling, but I do have all proven socials if yall actually want to make friends (DMs open), I just want to hear about the cool stories and stuff yall have since I was interested in ns system which my country doesn\u2019t have it as compulsory.

I have no brothers and my father attended NS awhile ago, so it would be great if I could get some answers to my questions \ud83d\ude0a\n\n1.\t\u2060If I were to sign on, should I apply for university first, then sign on via the Mindef website, if no, what is the proper pathway I should take while approaching this?\n2.\t\u2060In the 2 years of NS, what will I experience other than BMT?\n3.\t\u2060As a girl, will I still be routed to NS vocations like NDU and Commandos/Guards?\n4.\t\u2060Why should I not sign on? Do I have a better shot at a career in a private sector after uni?\n5.\t\u2060Is it true that all girls in NS will be on track to SCS or OCS?\n6.\t\u2060How worth it is the SAF scholarship?\n\n\nIf there is anything you think I should know or take as a precaution before signing on please let me know! It would be greatly appreciated as I\u2019m still abit clueless \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude13"

      "post_text": "Hi guys, I have yet to enter the force (waiting to be enlisted), but I am considering signing on to C4X since signing is best done during BMT, from what I have heard. I have read posts regarding signing on but they are about 3 years ago, so I'd like to gain a newer/fresher insight on the current state.  \n  \nLet me list out some of my concerns regarding signing on to C4X, hopefully any ex-regulars, current regulars of C4X, or even other vocation regulars could share their experience, stories or advice regarding this decision.\n\nPros:  \n  \n1. Sign-on bonus  \n  \n2. University tuition is paid for fully (this to me is somewhat of a concern, because my GPA will definitely not land me in NUS (yes I tried, my GPA (Dip in CyberSec) + Certs + Personal Projects + Extra-Curricular activities + Work Experience), SIT is my only hope. So if SIT rejects me, I would have no choice but to study private/overseas uni if I want to attain a Degree. My parents specifically told me that if I were to study overseas or private, I would be paying for the fees myself.  \n  \n3. Decent starting pay post uni (from what I heard about $5K base/starting pay for uni graduates), and will only increase with promotions. Not sure if there is risk pay for C4X.\n\n4. Career and Financial stability, in terms of, I won't just get fired out of nowhere. (Unless I make a serious mistake, and the fact that I can continue my position even after my bond ends)\n\n5. C4X aligns with my career path and studies, so I would assume that with the work that I would be doing in C4X, it would minimally provide me with beneficial knowledge/experiences/skillsets that are transferrable into the private sector, be it soft-skills or hard-skills.\n\n6. Regular pay during my 2 year mandatory service\n\nCons:\n\n1. 6 year bond, so when im out of SAF, im already 32. Meaning im tied to SAF for about the next 10-12 years or so, no room for regrets\n\n2. Heard about the toxic work culture regarding superiors and regulars, but im not sure if it is as rampant in C4X\n\n3. Potentially thrown into some sai kang BS role, which will provide me with absolutely nothing in value\n\n  \nFor some context, I don't really mind going through OCS to become occifer, if it is part of the requirement as a sign-onee then so be it.   \n  \nI have also worked at a private sector company before, doing cyber related work. It is just 9 hours a day x5 every week (office / WFH), I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a mixture of boring/super-stressful, I would say that (in my opinion), most of the full timers there are overworked, juggling 7 concurrent projects at once with super tight deadlines.\n\nEdit: Also how are leaves and holidays like? Am I tied to Singapore in the long run or can I take leave for travels etc. as well?"

      "post_text": "Hi everyone! For context, my bf and I started our LDR since before he started NS (I'm from a different country), and we've visited each other IRL a few times. Our relationship has been stable and healthy for the most part.\n\nDuring BMT, he made a lot of effort to call and text me whenever possible and give a lot of assurance, even though his schedule was packed. During weekend book outs we could spend almost the entire time together, and I would listen to try to understand the NS workings since I myself am not from Singapore haha.\n\nFast forward to after BMT, he's in infantry and now spends almost 0 time with me. From my understanding he's around the same levels of busy as before, yet he spends much less time with me now. When confronted, he just told me that he has more friends and is getting along well with the sergeants, so he enjoys his time much more now with friends like ordering out and spending bookouts with them.\n\nThing is, he can go a full 24 hours without texting me, sometimes won't call, always saying it's past lights out by the time he's free. During weekends he spends more time going out with friends and family and doing tasks like getting a haircut or buying things he needs for NS. And whatever free time he has in between all of that goes to watching youtube or playing games. \n\nUsually, I wouldn't mind these things, but the change is so abrupt and sudden that it raises room for suspicion. He literally made an entire personality change within 1 week of entering infantry. Sometimes we're only spending 5 minutes per day talking to each other (text/call). And sometimes on weekends we may only spend 8 hours together (for sleep call - so we're not even talking).\n\nI considered he may be cheating. He told me once that he was envious of his other friends who got to go out on actual dates with their gfs during bookout on night/weekend (since we can't, I'm not in SG). But he's told me he has me as his lockscreen and all his platoon and sergeants know about us dating. He's also told his parents and siblings. I also don't think he has the balls to cheat to be honest. I have access to contact his closest friends and family to ask, but haven't in case I'm just overreacting.\n\nI'm overall just afraid that the lack of quality time may completely dwindle the relationship, especially as it is LDR where consistent communication is key. I think I myself may also start losing passion in the relationship as I spend so much more time on myself and my friends/colleagues compared to him. To me it almost feels like I have no boyfriend except for an hour a day, especially when my love language is quality time.\n\nAny advice/opinions would be great, especially from girlies who are also dating recruits!\n\nEdit: there are so many sickos in my DMs asking me if I wanna cheat on him. Get a grip bruhh \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit 2: For clarification, I'm not in SG Uni and I'm working corporate from a different country. yes I'm older than him haha"
