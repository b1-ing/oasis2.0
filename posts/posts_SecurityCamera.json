We have equipment on the property so we are looking for something that can locally record with battery power and would be preferable if it either has solar power built in or the option to add to it would be nice as well. Should also note we'd rather not have to use cellular either, we aren't really concerned with being able to access it remotely, Just that it can capture decent video with motion detection and a decently wide view.

This will serve as security,  as well as a way for me to check in on him as he is a fall risk. I bought blink cameras (not knowing they don't record 24/7) so I'm looking for a reliable company,  and an affordable camera that records 24/7 as well as motion notifications, live viewing theough an app and 2 way auto. I will 100% pay for a subscription.  Just want it to work. It will have access to power, so no power bank needed. But wifi internet perfered. Thank you so much for giving your input.\n"

    "post_text": "hello community!\n\nanyone have any suggestion on a reliable security camera system that'll record audio uninterrupted, (maybe lower down ambience of the outside sounds city, etc, not sure if that sort of thing exist?), great night vision, records 24/7, and one that i can add more cams for different angles if needed. I think most, of not a lot, are standardized security cams comes with apps for you to download the videos or see your cams live. \n\n  \nI'm not sure if wired or wireless/wi-fi would be the best route (not sure of any of this, hoping some of you can shed light on which would be best to have) in case we lose internet, I'd like to have the security cams still recording. Please help &lt;3 thank you in advance.\n\n  \nnote: I'm not sure if i need to mention this; but looking for a home in the states (USA)"

I don’t want to stay up all night watching it—I just need to capture what’s happening.\n\nIs there a Wi-Fi camera that won’t get blown out at night through a window? Zoom would be great (optical preferred), but not critical. I just want a clear image so I can finally get to the bottom of this. \n\nFor reference, I've tried several Wyze and Reolink cameras with limited success. The quality just isn't good.

I most likely will add more cameras down the road. Right now I have eight Yi cameras, I know about all the issues and the ads on the app, part of the reason I am moving on. That being said, I guess I'd lean towards an eight-port NVR. I have been looking at Hikvision and Amcrest products primarily, so to give you a sense, I am looking to spend $600-$800 or so on both the NVR and a dual-lens camera. I am looking to monitor about 50 feet of area on the front of my house by a garage and have it shoot out about 100 feet past the driveway into the street.\n\nThe question I have right now is about the Amcrest dual lens cameras on Amazon. One comes in at $400 and is 8MP per lens, and the cheaper $180 one appears to be 4MP per lens. Oh, and the $400 one has 131 feet of night color while the $180 one has 65 feet of night color. I am not sure if that is worth the extra $220, including twice the megapixels, or if that is a gimmick. Below are the links to the two cameras.\n\nAlso, I am pretty open to other brands, and to be honest, I have no real idea about NVRs and whether more expensive ones offer features worth the extra cost. All I know is some require you to buy an HDD, and some have them installed.\n\nMy main focus in this system would be ease of monitoring from an iPhone. I have had enough of watching goofy ads on the Yi app. I even tried to toggle off the personal ads, but I still seem to get them. Oh, and something from a brand that has a good reputation and products, as I can see myself replacing the rest of the Yi cameras in the future. The camera in my front is the one I look at probably 95% of the time, so that is the top priority now.\n\nI am open to everyone's opinion and expertise.

Only the older models need the Home hub, newer models connect directly to wifi and then the app/cloud for anytime access like Ring cameras.\n\nOverall I am impressed with the Baseus app, the functionality offers some unique things over Ring's app (I have the Video Doorbell Pro 2), but otherwise functions and feels the same level of polished as Ring's app, just with no cloud sub needed.\n\nI think for the price, can't go wrong really, long as your home WiFi connection is robust. For ref my router is a Linksys Velop MX4200 Mesh series, I only have 1 in the middle of the house, and that is reached by the S2 by the shed at the end of the garden, as well as the S1 lite upstairs."

I’d like to add an exterior camera to cover the outside of my local market, and also replace the existing camera monitoring the counter with a high-end model. Ideally, the new counter camera should offer crystal clear image ( when i playback the video to still keep the high quality when i zoom in — I need to clearly see the banknotes when they’re counted or handed over by customers )  \n  \nFor the exterior camera, I’m aiming for something reliable and high-quality. If it has built-in lights or features that can help deter thieves or burglars at night, that would be a huge bonus.  \n  \nI’ve spoken to a few security camera vendors in my area, but it feels like they’re just trying to push what they have in stock. So I’d much rather hear real recommendations from you guys.  \n  \nAlso, I’d like to install two additional cameras on my house for personal security and to monitor the surroundings when I’m not home. Since the market is located at my house's ground floor, I can connect them directly to the market's NVR also.  \n  \nMy budget is around **€150 to €300 per camera if there's something really worth it.**  \n  \nThanks in advance — I really appreciate your help!"

This house has been a huge nuisance and we need to be documenting the disruptive and destructive behavior. We are dealing with parties, ride shares dropping off big groups of people, intoxicated people hanging out in the front yard and street, reckless driving, loud noise and illegal parking.\n\nI purchased a solar powered ieGeek brand camera. It is motion activated and even after playing with the settings a ton, it catches every kind of motion EXCEPT the ones we want across the street. Our tree blowing in the wind and cars driving by will set it off, but not activity at the rental property. We’ve only been able to capture things when we know it’s happening and we can manually record using the app. Of course the bad behavior is often happening in the middle of the night, and the camera stinks in the dark, even on the highest sensitivity motion detection. It has a “human detection” feature, but it doesn’t work. I played with the settings and even danced around in the front yard in front of the camera and it did not record me. \n\nDoes anyone have a rec for a camera that would be better for this kind of surveillance? Maybe something that just continually records and we could go through the footage and grab what we need? I’m not tech-savvy so not even sure what to look for. We have a Ring doorbell, so I’m wondering if one of their products could be a good fit? To capture the right angle, the camera needs to be in a place where we can not easily run a cord. I’m hoping to keep the cost reasonable. "

I want to be able to review footage for 2-3 months and quickly find when the damage happens. I thought if there's a recording software that generateds a few pictures every day as a summary feed for quick reference, that would be great. Even better if I can host an AI to review footage. \nDoes anyone have suggestions for a solution? "

I don\u2019t have a cloud subscription or account, and all four cameras record locally to the microSD cards I've installed in each.\n\nI'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand \u00a0know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that\u2019s how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. \n\nIf this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that\u2019s how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren\u2019t first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house\u2019s Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers. Thank you!"

I have no particular need to see security footage at this moment, but I have an interest in this because I have come across this situation before. In college, my laptop was stolen from a campus common area in which there was a security camera. When I went to the campus security to see if they could see the security footage for any insight into who stole the laptop, they said they couldn't access the footage and didn't have the expertise to review it even if they did. In my mind, it seems it shouldn't be hard to pull up footage from the date and approximate time an event happened and then examine the footage, but I also want to give people the benefit of the doubt that they aren't being difficult for no reason or lazy. Is there something more complicated about the process? Is it more about legal liability/not wanting to have to get involved in any sort of court proceedings? Are they renting cameras from the actual police and therefore don't own it or have log in credentials? If anyone knows why this is a phenomenon, let me know! Super curious.\n\nEdited photo to take out city name. "

I\u2019m reasonably tech savvy but I\u2019m not interested in complicated setup and maintaining a server or some central hub. I only need 1 camera. \n\nRight off the bat I\u2019ll say I\u2019m not paying for a subscription service. \n\nI want just 1 camera for inside a small apartment, that will give me notifications if it catches movement. If I can get live video of that movement that\u2019s even better. We will only use the camera when away and at night. I don\u2019t want an internet capable (I.e hackable) camera watching me all day, so I also don\u2019t want cloud services if possible. Local storage is preferred. I do understand that getting live footage goes thru an app and they can aquire it that way\u2026 if I have to deal with that then I will. But local storage is still preferred because I\u2019m not paying anyone to store footage I don\u2019t care about long term. \n\nDo they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don\u2019t care about cataloging footage. It\u2019s purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. \n\nDue to other post recommends. I\u2019m looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I\u2019m having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I\u2019m not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it\u2019s only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. \n\nAm I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill? \n"

Other examples are motion activated lights specifically on our side of the house and no other. We have 2 cameras for legal evidence but don\u2019t survey everything, recently when one of our cameras had to be charged he cut down a post of ours in our backyard which we were gonna use to create a blind so he couldn\u2019t watch us on his camera , since the camera was down we have no evidence or proof and are therefore not doing anything about this . Can anyone help us know what Brand of camera this is and if it has the ability to record audio . Any legal advice would be nice too , there\u2019s also plenty more examples of harassment but the list goes on for a long time"

AC power would also be easy to provide.\n* Since the NVR would be local to my network my goal would be avoid apps and subscriptions and I would simply view the videos locally as needed.\n* I would prefer a WiFi compatible NVR and IP cameras so I don't have to run a bunch of Ethernet cable. My wireless network reaches outside just fine and has plenty of bandwidth currently.\n* 1080p video quality is fine and 30fps would be nice to have but not necessary. I don't need 4K@60fps or anything like that haha.\n* IP cameras that have some level of low light support would be another nice to have.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Thank you for helping out a security camera beginner!"

I bought it because it has an onboard built-in camera which could be used to keep the camera on when the power goes out. Next thing that is important is 24/7 video recording. And it would get power from the current doorbell transformer. I also want to use the original chime. Well, I temp installed the doorbell after setting it up and when I connected it to the doorbell transformer power it detected power and then gave me other options. Basically it either allows 24/7 recording without the use of my original chime or it allows use of my original chime without 24/7 recording. Both features are not allowed to function together by which is a major deal breaker for me. Anyone know if a workaround is possible? The reality is that this is a simple fix with a firmware update if Eufy so chose. I don\u2019t have any interest in a camera with a subscription and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve stuck with eufy.  I emailed eufy support about it and am waiting for their response."

Previous provider took back their mesh system. New ISP does have better wifi coverage throughout our home, except in the garage and basement bathroom(wifi reaches about 70% of the time). Now in order to get full wifi coverage in the garage, I was thinking of getting a single unit of a TP link wifi extender/AP/mesh. Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.\n\nCurrently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  \nWould my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?\n\nAny advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.\n\nedit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.  \nNVR in living room to the POE switch in the garage are connected via an ethernet line that runs outside the house. i don't have the skills to run these lines within the walls nor do i have the time. lol. and would/could not spend upwards and maybe over $1000 CAD on getting it done professionally."

      "post_text": "I'm working on a UNV NVR system with 100% UNV cameras, no third party hardware. The NVR is a 302-16E-P16-B.  Due to the facility layout having multiple buildings we have four cameras in another building and those four cameras are connected via fiber back to the NVR and plugged into switchport 16 on the rear 16 port PoE switch of the NVR.\n\nHowever, for some reason the NVR does not seem to 'like' a 2nd switch where multiple cameras are residing on one interface,  I've seen this before at another site too where multiple cameras shared one interface.  Sometimes one or two cameras will disappear and then reappear, sometimes they all disappear. The connection is via two Cisco switches on a GB fiber connection via Cisco SFP's.  Cisco switches show no port errors, no connection drops, nothing abnormal on the line between the buildings.\n\nSo is the built in switch on the NVR not a true switch or something unique to the UNV unit where it only wants to see one camera per interface?   Is there a workaround to fix the issue of the cameras disappearing and reappearing?  Thanks!"

When this happens my phone and laptop will have issues getting back into the cloud account as well.  I have raised multiple support tickets and have gotten nowhere with support.  The last one was to update to the latest version which has been done on all the sites but then again tonight it timed out again.  It also seems to be hit and miss on whether I can just sign them right back in or I have to wait for an hour or so like tonight.  The only thing i have noticed is that systems that are on V5 still do not appear to have this issue.  Just V6..  "

I don't need any audio features, absolutely don't want to deal with a subscription, don't really need it to record anything. I just need to be able to look in frequently to check on them without walking out there at all hours, especially when I have girls expecting babies. Night vision would be important but motion detection is not, the animals would set it off every few minutes and that seems silly. It would be technically indoors (the barn is a concrete block building but it does have little screened vents at the top and bottom of two walls) so it won't get wet but it could get cold (just above freezing at the lowest). There is power out there in the form of a regular outlet (I run ac and fans in the summer) so I'd prefer a wired camera. The wifi does just about reach I believe but doing high demand things like video calls in there has had some crunchiness. I imagine that if its just sending video out, no audio, and not receiving anything back it should work? I'd look into cellular but I have a feeling that would be more expensive and I'm on a tighter budget with this. \n\nI did do some looking of my own at first but all the cheap cameras seem to require subscriptions and have all sorts of extra bells and whistles that really seem like overkill in this situation. I just need to know when one of the girls goes into labor or check in when I'm off the farm just in case. Any help here would be awesome!"
