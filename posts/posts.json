    "post_text": "I recently setup some Tapo C120 cameras around the house and over the weekend I was surprised to discover I can access them remotely to live stream, change settings, etc. I was out of the house in another part of the city, nowhere close enough to be connected my house’s wifi, and I was still able to live stream all four cameras from my phone via the app. I had assumed I could only access the cameras while at home connected to my house’s wifi. I don’t have a cloud subscription or account, and all four cameras record locally to the microSD cards I've installed in each.\n\nI'm new to this tech and I'd like to understand  know how this is possible, since the main reason I purchased these cameras is that I didn't want anything on the cloud servers and all recording to be hard recorded, so locally on drives like a microSD. I suspect the Tap app enables remote control/access of the cameras through the TP-Link cloud server. Once the cameras are configured and connected via the app and my Tapo ID, it establishes a link via the TP-Link cloud server to my cameras and that’s how I can live stream remotely and change any settings/make commands. \n\nIf this is correct, my question then is are my live streams and short detection videos when the cameras are triggered uploaded to the cloud server and that’s how I can view them remotely? I mean, how else would I be able to remotely access the live stream and the video clips if they weren’t first uploaded to the TP-Link cloud server? I can edit these videos as well, really anything I could do on the app via my house’s Wifi. My concerns are for my privacy really and the reason I set these up to only record locally to a microSD. It would be helpful to understand what the intricacies of the tech process here are, and to what extend my videos and live streams are on the TP-Link cloud servers. Thank you!",

I have no particular need to see security footage at this moment, but I have an interest in this because I have come across this situation before. In college, my laptop was stolen from a campus common area in which there was a security camera. When I went to the campus security to see if they could see the security footage for any insight into who stole the laptop, they said they couldn't access the footage and didn't have the expertise to review it even if they did. In my mind, it seems it shouldn't be hard to pull up footage from the date and approximate time an event happened and then examine the footage, but I also want to give people the benefit of the doubt that they aren't being difficult for no reason or lazy. Is there something more complicated about the process? Is it more about legal liability/not wanting to have to get involved in any sort of court proceedings? Are they renting cameras from the actual police and therefore don't own it or have log in credentials? If anyone knows why this is a phenomenon, let me know!

I’m reasonably tech savvy but I’m not interested in complicated setup and maintaining a server or some central hub. I only need 1 camera. \n\nRight off the bat I’ll say I’m not paying for a subscription service. \n\nI want just 1 camera for inside a small apartment, that will give me notifications if it catches movement. If I can get live video of that movement that’s even better. We will only use the camera when away and at night. I don’t want an internet capable (I.e hackable) camera watching me all day, so I also don’t want cloud services if possible. Local storage is preferred. I do understand that getting live footage goes thru an app and they can aquire it that way… if I have to deal with that then I will. But local storage is still preferred because I’m not paying anyone to store footage I don’t care about long term. \n\nDo they make cameras that will just write over old data when the card storage is used up, essentially making it infinite storage? I don’t care about cataloging footage. It’s purely for notifying me if there is a break in or something. The apartment does not have an alarm system. \n\nDue to other post recommends. I’m looking at Reolink Poe cameras, something like an RLC-540A. But I’m having trouble determining if Poe means I can just splice it into my existing cat6 network, or if I would have to run new lines (deal breaker). I’m not interested in having to buy special software or a hub of some type, because again it’s only 1 camera for when we are not occupying the space. \n\nAm I being unrealistic with these requirements or is there something that fits the bill? \n",

Other examples are motion activated lights specifically on our side of the house and no other. We have 2 cameras for legal evidence but don’t survey everything, recently when one of our cameras had to be charged he cut down a post of ours in our backyard which we were gonna use to create a blind so he couldn’t watch us on his camera , since the camera was down we have no evidence or proof and are therefore not doing anything about this . Can anyone help us know what Brand of camera this is and if it has the ability to record audio . Any legal advice would be nice too , there’s also plenty more examples of harassment but the list goes on for a long time",

AC power would also be easy to provide.\n* Since the NVR would be local to my network my goal would be avoid apps and subscriptions and I would simply view the videos locally as needed.\n* I would prefer a WiFi compatible NVR and IP cameras so I don't have to run a bunch of Ethernet cable. My wireless network reaches outside just fine and has plenty of bandwidth currently.\n* 1080p video quality is fine and 30fps would be nice to have but not necessary. I don't need 4K@60fps or anything like that haha.\n* IP cameras that have some level of low light support would be another nice to have.\n\nWhat do y'all think?

Next thing that is important is 24/7 video recording. And it would get power from the current doorbell transformer. I also want to use the original chime. Well, I temp installed the doorbell after setting it up and when I connected it to the doorbell transformer power it detected power and then gave me other options. Basically it either allows 24/7 recording without the use of my original chime or it allows use of my original chime without 24/7 recording. Both features are not allowed to function together by which is a major deal breaker for me. Anyone know if a workaround is possible? The reality is that this is a simple fix with a firmware update if Eufy so chose. I don’t have any interest in a camera with a subscription and that’s why I’ve stuck with eufy.  I emailed eufy support about it and am waiting for their response.",

Problem is, I'm not sure if it'll work with how I setup the cameras for our home. We do spend a lot of time in the garage to hangout as well, so we do need wifi there.\n\nCurrently, 4 cameras are connected to a POE switch in the garage, that POE is connected via ethernet to the NVR in the living room that is directly connected to our NAH/Modem/Router.  \nWould my attached diagram work for both wifi in the garage and NVR receiving the camera signals?\n\nAny advise/answer would be greatly appreciated before I make a purchase.\n\nedit: all connections are hard-wired. i just didnt want to have to drill extra holes. the AP would act as a pass-through in between the NVR and POE switch.  \nNVR in living room to the POE switch in the garage are connected via an ethernet line that runs outside the house. i don't have the skills to run these lines within the walls nor do i have the time. lol. and would/could not spend upwards and maybe over $1000 CAD on getting it done professionally.",

Due to the facility layout having multiple buildings we have four cameras in another building and those four cameras are connected via fiber back to the NVR and plugged into switchport 16 on the rear 16 port PoE switch of the NVR.\n\nHowever, for some reason the NVR does not seem to 'like' a 2nd switch where multiple cameras are residing on one interface,  I've seen this before at another site too where multiple cameras shared one interface.  Sometimes one or two cameras will disappear and then reappear, sometimes they all disappear. The connection is via two Cisco switches on a GB fiber connection via Cisco SFP's.  Cisco switches show no port errors, no connection drops, nothing abnormal on the line between the buildings.\n\nSo is the built in switch on the NVR not a true switch or something unique to the UNV unit where it only wants to see one camera per interface?   Is there a workaround to fix the issue of the cameras disappearing and reappearing?  Thanks!",

    "post_text": "Alright, I think this is the right place to ask this? I'm trying to find a basic camera to monitor my barn. I don't need any audio features, absolutely don't want to deal with a subscription, don't really need it to record anything. I just need to be able to look in frequently to check on them without walking out there at all hours, especially when I have girls expecting babies. Night vision would be important but motion detection is not, the animals would set it off every few minutes and that seems silly. It would be technically indoors (the barn is a concrete block building but it does have little screened vents at the top and bottom of two walls) so it won't get wet but it could get cold (just above freezing at the lowest). There is power out there in the form of a regular outlet (I run ac and fans in the summer) so I'd prefer a wired camera. The wifi does just about reach I believe but doing high demand things like video calls in there has had some crunchiness. I imagine that if its just sending video out, no audio, and not receiving anything back it should work? I'd look into cellular but I have a feeling that would be more expensive and I'm on a tighter budget with this. \n\nI did do some looking of my own at first but all the cheap cameras seem to require subscriptions and have all sorts of extra bells and whistles that really seem like overkill in this situation. I just need to know when one of the girls goes into labor or check in when I'm off the farm just in case. Any help here would be awesome!",

    "post_text": "I just ordered two TP-Link **Tapo SolarCam C402 Kits** and they’ll be arriving next week. Will be using them strictly with a Micro SD card and no cloud storage.  We're planning to install them at our family cabin so everyone can keep an eye on the place when we’re not there—mainly to monitor the garden, lake area, and any animals that might be getting into things. I was wondering if there’s any way to set the cameras up so I can give people a **link** to view the feed, **without requiring everyone to download the Tapo app**. Ideally, I’d like it to be **“public” in the sense that it's easily accessible** (like via a URL), but still **private so that only immediate family members can view it**—not just anyone with the link. If that’s not possible, is there at least a way for multiple people to have their own Tapo accounts and log in to view the cameras and or get notifications? Just looking for the simplest way to share access with family without making it a hassle. Thanks!",

The problem is that we don’t have a computer to run the stream so we need the feed to go from the camera straight to the TV somehow. We can buy a smart TV and weatherproof camera but are at a loss on what to get and how to actually set it up. None of us are very tech savvy, we just want a way to watch our bees! Any help is very appreciated!!! Thank you!",

Just not sure if there's anything out there like it. \n\nBasically, is there a system that let's me connect the cameras to a non-internet wifi network (basically a router with no-modem) and transfer footage to an offline central storage hub that way (like an computer or harddrive also on the network)\n\nWould a normal wifi-camera set up allow me to do that?\n\nSorry if the question doesn't quite make sense. Im just not familiar enough with the industry to know what terminology to even look for. I've been hesitant to look at home secuirty systems because I don't like the idea of someone potentially being able to get into my home Internet wifi, and access the system from the internet (yes, I'm paranoid).\n\nFigure with a non-internet connected wifi, at least someone would have to be phsycially close to try to get in.\n\nThoughts? Ideas? ",
