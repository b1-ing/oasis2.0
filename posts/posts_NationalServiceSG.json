For context I went to my medical check up recently and when they asked whether I had any mental health issues, I declared that I potentially had mild asd.\n\nFor a couple of years, I strongly suspect that I had at least mild autism as I related to many of its symptoms. \n\nThe thing is that I never got it officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist. In fact I've never even been to one(only counsellors) as it‚Äôs very hard to find mental health help and proper diagnostic channels. Plus in NS, I'm worried that I'll face issues if I do end up having the condition and remain undiagnosed. Even if I don't have it I hope to put my anxieties about having it to rest. \n\nAfter I declared that, cmpb then made a medical review appointment with the SAF psychiatrist at cmpb. And with information online, I‚Äôm unclear as to how the whole process works.\n\nSo to those which have been to medical reviews with the psychiatrist after the check up\n\n1) What can the cmpb psychiatrist do? If they can't diagnose then are they able to help refer me? \n\n2) As a general rule of thumb, should I go to another psychiatrist outside of Cmpb before the medical review(which is in less than 2 months) to get documents to bring to the medical review? What should I do if there isn't enough time beforehand\n\n3) Other than that how should I present my case to the cmpb psychiatrist in general? \n\nThanks so much in advance cause I'm very anxious over this for the past week üôèüôè\n"

    "post_text": "Been a long time since i ord from national service. But looking back, i feel as though we are all trading our lives to beautify all the regular‚Äôs resume.\n\nIt is far worse when your superior is a maniac. Specifically mentioning my then OC xxxx(had to remove his name, by mod). His current position a Major now.\n\nGuy is fucking sick in the head. Pulls the command team individually to demand that you add him as a friend on Facebook (then a popular app) and forces you to accept his friend request. This was just the start.\n\nHe then adds you into a group where he posts stuff. Be it comments, new posts, new picture, he expects the command team to like anything he posts. If you don‚Äôt, he tricks you into a hearty MacDonald breakfast and fucks you on the spot in the company office, screaming like a baby.\n\nHe expects the command team to be some sort of super hero. No reporting sick, no excuses, one has to suck it up and endure whatever you are having and push through the activity. Because either that or he treats you like you are malingering (aka chao keng).\n\nHe is the kind of asshole you would expect where he undermines your ability as a commander. Giving you instructions like for example, ‚Äúyou have to hold the ground and uphold the standards of your men‚Äù, ‚Äúall your men have to have ippt gold by this month‚Äùbut then he does the opposite and destroys this by saying its okay you can do better in-front of your men and fucks you up behind the scene.\n\nOr screaming in your face demanding you to give him the exact parade state, expecting you to tell him the entire company‚Äôs individual status, sustained injury, duration of respective individual status and at the end of this ordeal, tells you he was just joking and tells you not to take it to heart.\n\nJust imagine you just came back from a 16km route march. He shouts for the whole command team to gather and knock us down right under the noses of our men in full gear.\n\nThe reason(s)? One, the man did not know how to sing the ace brigade song. Two, one of the ice tray was not in use. Mind you we just reached the form up area getting ready for cool down exercise.\n\nThis mother fucker is so sly in the head, when you tell him something that is not appealing to him, or rather not the answer he wants, he was already thinking of 30 other ways to fuck you up.\n\nJust take it that you sustained an injury internally, you went to a specialist to get it checked (always go to a specialist for your check up it is more precise and accurate).\n\nPrior to visiting a specialist, i raise the issue on the pain i was experiencing.\n\nThis is what he told me.\n‚ÄúIf your men were to raise this up to you, would you let them visit the MO‚Äù\n\nMy reply.\n‚ÄúGiven the benefit of doubt i would allow them to visit the MO to get it checked‚Äù\n\nHis reply.\n‚ÄúBut you are a commander!‚Äù\n\nHow do you reply him? Cuz at that point after he said that i felt as though i gotta suck it up cuz i am a commander.\n\nAnw the specialist tells you that if you were to continue the way you train, you will worsen your injury. So the doctor gives you long term LD to prevent you to further trigger your already affected area.\n\nYou have an overseas exercise and before it starts you hand him this information and the necessary document. Him being a bipolar fuck in the head. Wanted to give you a good blasting but holds himself back (you can tell from his facial expression).\n\nAt the back of his mind he was already thinking of ways to make use of you to his advantage. Immediately the next day he sends you out to be some sort of ic out in the jungle, assuring you that he will be there to help you out in the start and end of the exercise to not worsen your injury.\n\nEnd of exercise. What started off as 1 alicepack and an assault pack (for signal set) ended off with the two mentioned above with the addition of 15 jerry cans, 2 trash bag of instant ice. The fucker, no where to be found.\n\nWhen you were back in camp on your fours due to excruciating pain, clown just walks up to you and says:‚Äù you are back already?‚Äù.\n\nTwo more things to add:\n\n1.\t‚Å†this guy loves sleeping and spooning people in bed. To which i feel he have groomed 2 guys to become gay like actual gay. (1 was a spec and another a store-man sitting in jail time)\n2.\t‚Å†This guy loves acting, in my honest opinion if he were to be in the film industry he might just get Oscar award. Why so? Because he loves crying on the spot. So one of our spec have passed on due to self infliction. We all attended the wake. This bipolar fuck was still bossing us around asking us to fill up the space in the front two rows at the wake, where by tradition was suppose to be reserved for immediate family. He then proceeds to show crocodile tears while saying how much regret he has on not treating him better.\n\nIn short just do within your means and do not over exert yourself for these type of fuckers. Honestly its not worth trading your life to beautify their resume. As much as possible try to do what is required but there is no point for you to injure yourself and affecting your overall health in the long run.\n\nIf your life is in any danger don‚Äôt be afraid to call the saf hotline. Just because you are a commander doesn‚Äôt mean you are not human. I mean if your men is smart enough to call saf hotline you should do the same (unless you sign on).\n\nSpecial mention on him screaming at one of my man to win the soldier strong internal competition, particularly tire flipping, causing him to sprain his back, then made the command team to think my trooper was malingering.\n\nAlso, yes we won the competition got some belt (looks similar to WWE belt) but our PC gave it away because he felt that some rifle coy trooper deserve it better. \n\nOhhh boy you gotta see how this prick got so infuriated and lashed at my PC back then. Its was as though a kid didn‚Äôt get his sweet and was throwing a fit."

This awakened some mid-life crisis within me. \nI have been stuck doing a 8-5 office job for the last 3 years. It‚Äôs honest work, hard work but honestly not that fulfilling. \nI am interested in signing on to the SPF but idk what‚Äôs the plausibility of this idea.\nFYI. I‚Äôm 28M. I have finished my NS liabilities. But during my NS I was PES E9 cause of some physical injury  ü§≠. But honestly, it has never really impacted me. I exercise regularly and my physical fitness is quite good. \nAnd in case some of you are telling me I shouldn‚Äôt fall for this once in a lifetime gimmick. I think I have already made up my mind. I just want to know what are the roadblocks ahead walking on this path. \n\nI want to know the following:\n1. I am PES E9 but to sign on I need to be PESB1 minimally. How to get reassessment of my PES?\n2. What are the chances of getting my PES B1 status if I suffer from any 1 of the following illnesses:\n    a. Slip Disk\n    b. Hole in my heart but not life threatening?\n    c. Arm / leg fracture\n    d. Bad Liver\n    e. Left 1 kidney\n    f. Cancer Survivor\n    g. Hearing / sight problem\n    h. Ligament tear\nP.S. I am just listing all these problems down cause IDK what‚Äôs the MO stand on all these issues now. Appreciate it if you can give me a sensing. Previously, these are what some of my batch mates are suffering from during my time. \n\nAlso does SPF Medical Review follow SAF Medical Review standards?\n\nAppreciate it if you guys can share your experience on this.\n"

Also, I used to 3 major carbuncles/cysts at my nose area but the remaining scars gets inflamed and swell often usually when i sweat or in contact of allergens like dust (the same goes for my cyst)  \nShe said that lazer surgery could minimize the scars and its effects but also they are not covered by insurance due to also being a cosmetic reason.\n\nI heard that 11b could cover surgical treatments but im not sure whether they cover cosmetic reasons. If they can, what should be the procedure be like when i enlist and do i raise this up rn before en listing at cmpb or during bmt. I alrdy have the dermatologist memo that I have these conditions but Im visiting her again soon as I heard that I need another memo for specific prescriptions for medicine that im taking rn to suppress inflammation and infection."

I have been working hard as a biochem student and have knowledge regarding wound treating, pharmaceuticals, and human anatomy (also quite a bit of disease diagnosing and dissection using animal models), and I often collaborate well within a team as a leader (with rather positive morale). Thus I was wondering if there is still a chance for me to become a medic or sergeant as a PR... (or military police? I wanna seek some purpose during NS as well)\n\nHas there been cases of Chinese PR been able to join the SCS (even better OCS but I wouldn't even dream of it) or been allocated to special vocations such as medics in SAF? Or is it extremely rare for a PR to get these vocations no matter how hard they try due to preference towards citizens?\n\nI'm quite ignorant regarding NS facts so any piece of opinion or advice will be greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: Thx yall!

I know it‚Äôs a big decision, especially with NS obligations, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has gone through this or heard of someone who has? What was the process like? Did you face any issues with MINDEF or ICA? I read that you need to submit forms like Annex A and B, and maybe a clearance letter from MINDEF if you‚Äôre serving, but I‚Äôm not sure how it works mid-BMT. Also, any long-term consequences (like re-entering SG or future job passes) I should know about? Appreciate any advice or experiences you can share! Thanks!"

Reason was because my current job is mundane but pay is relatively ok - 4+on my 3rd year. Thus me exploring my options and finding jobs that seem more meaningful and stimulating. I am also on my final year in local Uni taking part time degree in Business.\n\nI was keen to explore more on cyber defence and security thus applying for the role. I have my MAPAS test and interview scheduled next week. However, upon speaking with the recruiter, he mentioned that I should apply for MIE instead due to my lack of experience.\n\nI looked at the role and realised that the trainee and actual pay was very low, and progression doesnt seem that good especially going in as ME1. Should I still attempt to go for the interview for C4X or should I just cancel the interview to not waste my time and their time? I am aware of the pros and cons of signing on and I am ok with them apart from the low pay."

Lastly I had an old Achilles injury from basketball on my right leg that I did not declare before entering as I wanted to try and go throught the whole bmt experience, however after doing outfield, my Achilles injury started acting up quite a bit after being in boots for so long which made me limp from place to place. Can I get some advice as on what to do and if I even have a chance to down pes? As I've gone for medical review and the doctors seem ABIT hesitant as to whether or not I can. As much as Ive been enjoying my experience in bmt so far I'm not to sure how far my body can go until it breaks down, to add on I'm part of mono guards which means I'll be doing gvt or GCC depending on my posting and truthfully I'm not planning to sign on so I do not want to risk my health just for two years of ns.

Gonna get my posting soon hopefully EMT if not Community Engagement HAHAHAHA.\n\nNgl it's pretty slack, BRT wasn't even a month for me it was like 3 and half weeks and you'll have quite abit of admin time. You won't do IPPT but you'll still do Foot drills and prepare for POP Parade and Rescue Training. As for punishment s you'll write lines that's about it. Some days will be chill and some days will be shag but you gotta remember to count yourself lucky that you're not in Tekong training.\n\nTry to not isolate yourself and dread over the month ah cause trust me you won't enjoy BRT if you do that instead socialise and get to know your bunkmates, your platoonmates and your Sgts, Enciks and Sirs ah. BRT was fun for me and I made alot of memories with them.\n\nLastly, since BRT is only gonna be a month, try not to MC or RSO cause really it's only a month and the time passes really fast and you'll miss out ah. Also please please don't give your Sergeants, Enciks and Sirs any trouble cause they will kenna and not us, try not to make their lives difficult since your BRT gonna be slack."

I'm PES B1 and my Singaporean friend told me that it is almost certain that I will be joining an active combat position after my BMT, which will heavily restrict my freedom. I'm worried as if thats the case and I stay busy the whole time throughout NS, I might not be able to add things I want to my current profile...\n\nAny advice on anything I could do or anything to expect please?

They gave me a referral to a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis but the earliest date they could book for me coincides with the day that I'll be in Tekong (confinement period, which is late this month).\n\nWill I even be able to show up? I don't think I can change the date that easily because this kind of thing is scheduled months ahead. The doctor suggested that if I really want a diagnosis ASAP and declare before I enlist, I'll have to go private. I'm thinking of following that advice but I don't know if it's any better. AFAIK the only downside to it is that my enlist date will be pushed back right? I don't really mind.\n\nI heard if people declare during confinement they'll have to be excused from showing up or sit out some activities, all that stuff. It sounds troublesome‚Äîmakes me think I should just follow the doctor's advice so that I won't have to worry about any complications while I serve. Because if they delay my enlist date, everything will be sorted out by then right?

This is not about him specifically, it is a reflection into the system.\n\n**I am a farmer.**  I grew up believing that hard work will get you somewhere, And of course, you must play your cards right. Like many of you, I did not have a father who was somebody. \\[In fact if you didn't know your father, that does make your father as a nobody\\]. I believe in meritocracy. Unfortunately, with how small Singapore is, and how everyone is related to one another, it can be hard to hold this value. You do feel a big sense of nepotism looming in the country. Whether that is true or not, I cannot comment on that. I am a farmer. \n\n [There is a comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1lzjju4/comment/n36tpzd/)in the tread that asks if the son made it to command school. That specific comment was answered with saying that the son did not make it into command school. Further replies speculated that the son did not pass IPPT as the definite reason. \n\nWhether was it because of the incident, or because of IPPT, I am happy. I am happy not because of the former chief of army's son did not make it to a command school, but because the system is working as it should be. \n\nA couple of years ago, Winston Choo, who was the first CDF, attended his grandson's officer commissioning ceremony.  [This was reported by mothership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02B1AYrV8w). There were a few comments that hinted at nepotism and it was \"given to him\". As quoted from one:\n\n&gt;Everyone knew he'd be an officer way before he even entered NS. Imagine the chief of defence's grandson not being a decorated soldier. His commanders were all probably too scared of doing anything to him.\n\nIt is easy to draw lines. And maybe more so that CDF is higher ranking then CoA. But CoA isn't some small time position either. So I show happiness, not because of the underachievement of someone, but because it is testament to my belief. The belief of meritocracy.\n\nOn the sideline I also wonder: what kind of pressure do the descendants of these high flyers face to perform, being involuntarily linked to that legacy. \n\nOh, and &gt;!because I said I am a farmer,  I[ do enjoy farming videos. ](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSSUEmdGL/)As the saying goes:  ËÄÅÂ∏àÊúâÁ©øË°£ÊúçÔºåÊàëÂ∑Æ‰∏ÄÁÇπËÆ§‰∏çÂá∫ËÄÅÂ∏à‰∫ÜÔºÅÔºÅ!&lt;"

It has been a really tough 2 years, going through all the grueling training, some bad commanders, some over demanding enciks, toxic environment at times and lousy cookhouse food. Seeing him endure and mature and able to discern good and bad characters is heartening. \n\nIt is time now for him to put NS behind him and embark on his next journey. \n\nCongrats to those who ORD this month too. To those who are going to enlist or going through the tough times, take good care of yourself and know that it will pass. Your family is proud of you too!"

While training at home, out of nowhere, I will have a mental breakdown out of nowhere and start crying for no reason. Even when I am consulting my parents, they told me it was alright and it's part of the process and told me not to worry about it. \n\nI tried to ignore all these negative thoughts but it just kept getting stronger and stronger. I can't even sleep at night with all these negative thoughts. I don't really know what to do. I had a slight depression once during secondary school due to bullying but it was fixed after multiple sessions of counselling and getting it over by myself. But this time, I felt really hopeless and it's been draining me to the point I just feel moody and depressed all the time. \n\nJust by thinking of the commanders, training and my platoon mates, I will start getting all these negative thoughts. Due to my previous experience with bullying, I am really nervous when interacting with new people and I am afraid of just being a burden to others if I am unable to do something etc. \n\nI really need help and I would like to ask if there is anything I can do about it. It is affecting me a lot these past few days. Really appreciate if anyone can give me any tips and suggestions. Thanks so much."

    "post_text": "So today I was arguing with my superior regarding an issue (which I think we were both at fault, and I hope to get some advice on how I can resolve it from here on).\n\nContext: I'm an ASA, and in my office, the NSFs usually sleep during lunch time. I used to sleep at my office seat, but becos there's a ceiling light right above it, I can never sleep well so yesterday, I tried to find a new room to sleep in. I found this room which was supposed to be a lecture room (it just has stacked chairs and tables and nth else), and to my knowledge, it is rarely used, and there are also no signs that say \"no entry\", so I just went in to sleep during lunch. \n\nThen after I fell asleep, my superior came to that room and started knocking on the door to tell me to get the fuck out of there, and then I woke up and got out. The moment I got out, he scolded me for being in that room.. but there were no senstive materials nor any \"no entry\" signs that say I couldnt enter that room. That is not the worst part. The worst is he accused me of stealing the key to unlock the room, even though it was already unlocked when I entered! \n\nApparently last week, the key to that room was stolen (which I didn't even know about.. I only know a key was stolen from my office, but not to that room), so he pushed the blame of the stealing the key on me and said I took it, even tho I didn't even do it.\n\nNow back to the argument today, I admit that I was at fault for supposedly trespassing into that room without legal permission (but at that point I didn't think so as there weren't any no entry signs, which most army rooms wld have if they are not meant to be entered), but my superior doesn't want to admit his mistake and apologise for wrongly accusing me of stealing/taking the key. His explanation? He said that yesterday when he accused me, once I said no I didn't do it, he didn't push on the accusation. Well from my memory, yesterday he kept asking me why the fuck i didnt admit stealing the key, and tbh jus becos u accused someone one time and stop after that doesnt mean it makes u correct right? It's like saying I murdered someone and I realised my mistake so I stop killing people, without admitting nor apologising, and that doesn't make me a murderer.\n\nSorry for the long rant, but to anyone who was patient and kind enough to read thru this whole passage, are u able to give me any suggestions on how to settle things nicely with my superior? I'm also scared that he may charge me for trespassing so I am hesitant to escalate it to higher ups. Please advice me on what to do, thanks!\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who have read through and provided me with your own personal advice on the situation. All of your advice and feedback, regardless of which side you are taking, have helped me comprehend the situation in a much more mature manner. My decision from here on now is to just let it go and let the past be the past. Thank you again for all your advice!! üôèüèªüôèüèª"

Since I was an introvert and my sense of humor doesn‚Äôt really match with my peers (I‚Äôm more comfortable in expressing myself in English), resulting in me not really having much friends irl. Luckily, I found some treasure friends online through videogames and one of them is an NSman, who used to be an Infantryman long ago.\n\nSince then, he was sharing to me a lot of things happening in his NS journey, from his first-ever BMT outfield where he had to practically dig shellscrapes to his funny moments where him and his friends were trolling on their sgt, literally everything. He said he developed best friendships in NS who were his ex-bunkmates where they ate, slept, did everything tgt, and definitely enjoyed the NS chapter of his life. He even showed me a few clips of both his and his friends‚Äô parade, whole time I was just amazed.\n\nI started forming a big passion in learning about NS systems (yet I‚Äôm not sg-based so my ns knowledge is very limited), but I do love reading ns stories so much, which is kinda weird coming from a foreigner; however this stems from the fact I don‚Äôt really enjoy how lonely uni is and how my life pattern just about same boring routine, slowly I found comfort in reading different experiences of nsf from all postings; from the bottommost stories (tiredness of combat load, unnecessary guard duty/night mission, screwed up meals, weird people etc.), to excitement in ord countdown. I don‚Äôt sugarcoat it and I know a lot people think 2-year length is a waste, yet I view it as a meaningful short pause from actual competitive real-life settings that you can only experience once in early 20s. And I admired yall so much for completing such an immense journey.\n\nI don‚Äôt have nsf friends and I‚Äôm super welcoming to know more about real-time experiences!! I hope I can find some people to discuss/talk (or you can rant) about ns. I‚Äôm so down to hear that rather than just watching Ah Boy to Men lol.\n\nEdit: I‚Äôm sorry if it seemed like I was trolling, but I do have all proven socials if yall actually want to make friends (DMs open), I just want to hear about the cool stories and stuff yall have since I was interested in ns system which my country doesn‚Äôt have it as compulsory.

I have been volunteering for National Day and though I‚Äôm aware that its a display of the more glamorous aspect of our nation‚Äôs defence, it has piqued my curiosity regarding a career in the army/airforce. If I choose to not sign on, I will likely pursue a PLE degree or law at the tertiary level. I have no brothers and my father attended NS awhile ago, so it would be great if I could get some answers to my questions üòä\n\n1.\t‚Å†If I were to sign on, should I apply for university first, then sign on via the Mindef website, if no, what is the proper pathway I should take while approaching this?\n2.\t‚Å†In the 2 years of NS, what will I experience other than BMT?\n3.\t‚Å†As a girl, will I still be routed to NS vocations like NDU and Commandos/Guards?\n4.\t‚Å†Why should I not sign on? Do I have a better shot at a career in a private sector after uni?\n5.\t‚Å†Is it true that all girls in NS will be on track to SCS or OCS?\n6.\t‚Å†How worth it is the SAF scholarship?\n\n\nIf there is anything you think I should know or take as a precaution before signing on please let me know!

Sign-on bonus  \n  \n2. University tuition is paid for fully (this to me is somewhat of a concern, because my GPA will definitely not land me in NUS (yes I tried, my GPA (Dip in CyberSec) + Certs + Personal Projects + Extra-Curricular activities + Work Experience), SIT is my only hope. So if SIT rejects me, I would have no choice but to study private/overseas uni if I want to attain a Degree. My parents specifically told me that if I were to study overseas or private, I would be paying for the fees myself.  \n  \n3. Decent starting pay post uni (from what I heard about $5K base/starting pay for uni graduates), and will only increase with promotions. Not sure if there is risk pay for C4X.\n\n4. Career and Financial stability, in terms of, I won't just get fired out of nowhere. (Unless I make a serious mistake, and the fact that I can continue my position even after my bond ends)\n\n5. C4X aligns with my career path and studies, so I would assume that with the work that I would be doing in C4X, it would minimally provide me with beneficial knowledge/experiences/skillsets that are transferrable into the private sector, be it soft-skills or hard-skills.\n\n6. Regular pay during my 2 year mandatory service\n\nCons:\n\n1. 6 year bond, so when im out of SAF, im already 32. Meaning im tied to SAF for about the next 10-12 years or so, no room for regrets\n\n2. Heard about the toxic work culture regarding superiors and regulars, but im not sure if it is as rampant in C4X\n\n3. Potentially thrown into some sai kang BS role, which will provide me with absolutely nothing in value\n\n  \nFor some context, I don't really mind going through OCS to become occifer, if it is part of the requirement as a sign-onee then so be it.   \n  \nI have also worked at a private sector company before, doing cyber related work. It is just 9 hours a day x5 every week (office / WFH), I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a mixture of boring/super-stressful, I would say that (in my opinion), most of the full timers there are overworked, juggling 7 concurrent projects at once with super tight deadlines.\n\nEdit: Also how are leaves and holidays like? Am I tied to Singapore in the long run or can I take leave for travels etc. as well?"

    "post_text": "Hi everyone! For context, my bf and I started our LDR since before he started NS (I'm from a different country), and we've visited each other IRL a few times. Our relationship has been stable and healthy for the most part.\n\nDuring BMT, he made a lot of effort to call and text me whenever possible and give a lot of assurance, even though his schedule was packed. During weekend book outs we could spend almost the entire time together, and I would listen to try to understand the NS workings since I myself am not from Singapore haha.\n\nFast forward to after BMT, he's in infantry and now spends almost 0 time with me. From my understanding he's around the same levels of busy as before, yet he spends much less time with me now. When confronted, he just told me that he has more friends and is getting along well with the sergeants, so he enjoys his time much more now with friends like ordering out and spending bookouts with them.\n\nThing is, he can go a full 24 hours without texting me, sometimes won't call, always saying it's past lights out by the time he's free. During weekends he spends more time going out with friends and family and doing tasks like getting a haircut or buying things he needs for NS. And whatever free time he has in between all of that goes to watching youtube or playing games. \n\nUsually, I wouldn't mind these things, but the change is so abrupt and sudden that it raises room for suspicion. He literally made an entire personality change within 1 week of entering infantry. Sometimes we're only spending 5 minutes per day talking to each other (text/call). And sometimes on weekends we may only spend 8 hours together (for sleep call - so we're not even talking).\n\nI considered he may be cheating. He told me once that he was envious of his other friends who got to go out on actual dates with their gfs during bookout on night/weekend (since we can't, I'm not in SG). But he's told me he has me as his lockscreen and all his platoon and sergeants know about us dating. He's also told his parents and siblings. I also don't think he has the balls to cheat to be honest. I have access to contact his closest friends and family to ask, but haven't in case I'm just overreacting.\n\nI'm overall just afraid that the lack of quality time may completely dwindle the relationship, especially as it is LDR where consistent communication is key. I think I myself may also start losing passion in the relationship as I spend so much more time on myself and my friends/colleagues compared to him. To me it almost feels like I have no boyfriend except for an hour a day, especially when my love language is quality time.\n\nAny advice/opinions would be great, especially from girlies who are also dating recruits!\n\nEdit: there are so many sickos in my DMs asking me if I wanna cheat on him. Get a grip bruhh üò≠\n\nEdit 2: For clarification, I'm not in SG Uni and I'm working corporate from a different country. yes I'm older than him haha"
